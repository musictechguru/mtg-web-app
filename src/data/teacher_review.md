# Teacher & Quiz Master Audit Report
**Objective:** Review questions for A-Level suitability, distractor quality, and pedagogical value.

## Volume 1: Fundamentals & Recording
### Topic: DECIBELS & DYNAMIC RANGE
**Q:** What is clipping?
-     Good sound quality
- (CORRECT) Distortion from signal too loud
-     Perfect recording
-     Very quiet sound
**Explanation:** Noise Floor: The 'silence' of a studio isn't truly silent. There's always preamble hiss, air conditioning, and electrical buzz. We record above this 'floor'.
---
### Topic: AUDIO FUNDAMENTALS
**Q:** A waveform shows:
-     Only color
- (CORRECT) Visual representation of sound over time
-     No information
-     Only temperature
**Explanation:** Waveform: The visual 'shape' of sound. A smooth curve is a flute; a jagged, spiky line is a distorted guitar. We edit audio by looking at these shapes.
---
### Topic: RECORDING CHAIN & SIGNAL PATH
**Q:** Instrument level (guitar) is approximately:
-     +4dBu
- (CORRECT) -20dBV to -10dBV
-     0dBFS
-     +20dBu
**Explanation:** S/PDIF: Consumer digital stereo. Uses RCA cables. Be careful—it looks like analog RCA but carries digital data.
---
## Volume 2: Microphones
### Topic: STRINGS
**Q:** Where on the guitar amp speaker should you place the microphone for the brightest, most aggressive tone?
-     At the edge of the speaker
-     Off-axis
- (CORRECT) On-axis
-     Behind the amplifier
**Explanation:** Center Cone (Cap): The speaker is brightest at the very center. As you move to the edge of the cone, the sound gets darker/warmer.
---
### Topic: DRUMS
**Q:** You want a modern, punchy rock drum sound. Which kick drum micing approach is most appropriate?
-     Single outside mic, 3 feet away
- (CORRECT) Inside mic very close to beater with possible outside mic for tone, minimal dampening
-     No kick mic, just overheads
-     Room mics only
**Explanation:** Drums require careful multi-mic phase alignment.
---
### Topic: HOW MICROPHONES WORK
**Q:** True or False: Dynamic microphones require phantom power to operate.
-     True
- (CORRECT) False
**Explanation:** Phantom power (+48V) is required to operate condenser microphones and active DI boxes.
---
## Volume 3: Synthesis
### Topic: VECTOR & PHASE DISTORTION SYNTHESIS
**Q:** Why isn't phase distortion widely used in modern synthesizers?
-     It sounds bad
- (CORRECT) Proprietary to Casio, less versatile than FM/subtractive, limited to vintage CZ instruments, not widely licensed
-     It's used in all modern synths
-     Too complex to implement
**Explanation:** Limiting is extreme compression (10:1+) used to prevent peaks from exceeding a ceiling.
---
### Topic: SPECIAL WAVEFORMS & OSCILLATORS
**Q:** For creating realistic wind or ocean effects, what type of noise and filtering would be most effective?
-     White noise, high-pass filter
- (CORRECT) Pink noise, low-pass filter, possibly with slow LFO modulation
-     No filtering needed
-     Square wave works better
**Explanation:** Filters remove specific frequencies from the spectrum.
---
### Topic: BASIC WAVEFORMS
**Q:** You're creating a warm bass sound. Comparing sine, triangle, and sawtooth waves before filtering, which would require the least filter cutting and why?
-     Sawtooth - already dark
- (CORRECT) Triangle or sine - they have fewer harmonics to begin with, requiring less aggressive filtering
-     All require the same filtering
-     Filters aren't used for bass
**Explanation:** Filters remove specific frequencies from the spectrum.
---
## Volume 4: Sampling
### Topic: BIT DEPTH & DYNAMIC RANGE
**Q:** What is the professional recording standard for bit depth?
-     8-bit
-     16-bit
- (CORRECT) 24-bit
-     12-bit
**Explanation:** Pro Standard: 24-bit. Used for recording/mixing to lower the noise floor and allow quiet recording without hiss.
---
### Topic: MIDI FUNDAMENTALS
**Q:** What does MIDI THRU do?
-     Sends new MIDI data
- (CORRECT) Echoes/copies the data received at MIDI IN
-     Stops MIDI signals
-     Converts MIDI to audio
**Explanation:** MIDI THRU: Through. Passes a copy of what came into the IN port. Used to chain devices.
---
### Topic: MIDI CONTROLLERS (CC)
**Q:** What is CC #1 typically used for?
-     Volume
- (CORRECT) Modulation wheel
-     Pan
-     Reverb
**Explanation:** Reverb creates the illusion of space and depth.
---
## Volume 5: Dynamic Processing
### Topic: VCA COMPRESSOR TECHNIQUES
**Q:** A Neve 33609 has distinctive "British" sound. What contributes to this?
-     Digital processing
- (CORRECT) Transformers and circuit topology
-     It's made in Britain
-     Character is marketing only
**Explanation:** VCA compressors offer precise control over attack and release and maintain separate Left/Right detection (or linked). They introduce less harmonic distortion than tubes but provide a distinct 'snap' or 'smack' to transients.
---
### Topic: PARALLEL COMPRESSION
**Q:** Parallel compression: dry at 0dB, compressed at -6dB. What's the blend ratio?
-     50/50
- (CORRECT) Approximately 70% dry, 30% compressed
-     30% dry, 70% compressed
-     Impossible to determine
**Explanation:** ratio determines the intensity of the gain reduction once the signal passes the threshold.
---
### Topic: KNEE & MAKEUP GAIN
**Q:** You compress a vocal and it becomes much quieter. What should you do to restore the level?
-     Increase the threshold
- (CORRECT) Add makeup gain to bring the output level back up
-     Decrease the ratio
-     Compressed signals should stay quiet
**Explanation:** Makeup Gain is used to boost the overall signal after compression to match the input level. This allows you to hear the effect of the compression without being fooled by volume changes.
---
## Volume 6: EQ & Stereo
### Topic: SURGICAL VS MUSICAL EQ
**Q:** After applying surgical cuts, you should:
-     Never question the cuts
- (CORRECT) Bypass and verify each cut is necessary
-     Add more cuts
-     Cuts are permanent
**Explanation:** Analog-modeled EQs are often 'Musical' because they have pre-set, wide Q curves and introduce harmonic saturation. Digital parametric EQs are 'Surgical' because they offer precise, colorless mathematical control.
---
### Topic: FILTER TYPES
**Q:** You apply a high-pass filter at 80Hz to a guitar. What happens to frequencies below 80Hz?
-     They get boosted
-     They stay the same
- (CORRECT) They get progressively reduced/removed
-     They get reversed
**Explanation:** A High-Pass Filter (HPF) allows highs to pass and cuts lows (removing rumble). A Low-Pass Filter (LPF) cuts highs. A Shelf boosts/cuts all frequencies above or below a point equally.
---
### Topic: ADDITIVE EQ TECHNIQUES
**Q:** Boosting adds level, which can affect what in your mix?
-     Panning
-     Reverb only
- (CORRECT) Headroom - may need to adjust levels
-     Nothing changes
**Explanation:** Additive EQ involves boosting frequencies to enhance character. 'Air' describes frequencies above 10kHz that add sheen. 'Presence' is typically 3-6kHz. 'Thump' is 60-100Hz.
---
## Volume 7: FX & Processors
### Topic: TAPE/DIGITAL DELAY & CHORUS
**Q:** Tape Speed affecting saturation: 15 IPS (inches per second) is typically:
-     Brighter/Cleaner than 30 IPS
- (CORRECT) Warmer/Bass-heavy with more bump than 30 IPS
-     Identical to digital
-     High Lo-fi
**Explanation:** Modulation effects (Chorus, Flanger, Phaser) are all based on delay frequencies being swept by an LFO. Flanging is <10ms delay, Chorus is 10-25ms. The LFO pitch-shifts the delayed copies, creating the 'swirling' effect.
---
### Topic: FEEDBACK & DELAY TYPES
**Q:** For slapback delay (single repeat), what feedback percentage?
-     100%
- (CORRECT) 0-10%
-     80%
-     200%
**Explanation:** Feedback controls how many times the delay repeats. Low feedback = 1 or 2 repeats. High feedback = infinite loops. 'Ping Pong' delay bounces repeats between the Left and Right speakers.
---
### Topic: REVERB FUNDAMENTALS
**Q:** When using reverb as an Insert effect, the "Mix" control should usually be:
-     100% Wet
-     0% Wet
- (CORRECT) Adjusted to blend Dry/Wet as desired
-     Disabled
**Explanation:** Reverb consists of Direct Sound, Early Reflections (giving cues about room size), and the Late Reflection Tail (giving cues about surface materials/RT60). Balancing these elements places a sound in a specific 'Z-plane' depth.
---
## Volume 8: Mastering
### Topic: TRUE PEAK (dBTP)
**Q:** Spotify rejects files above what true peak?
-     0.0 dBTP
- (CORRECT) -1.0 dBTP
-     +6 dBTP
-     No true peak requirement
**Explanation:** Streaming services require a True Peak ceiling of -1.0 dBTP to prevent distortion during lossy transcoding (AAC/Ogg). Mastering to -0.1 dBTP is risky for streaming delivery.
---
### Topic: MASTERING COMPRESSION
**Q:** Mastering compression attack set to 10ms means:
-     Instant compression
-     10 seconds
-     Attack doesn't matter
- (CORRECT) Preserves initial transient
**Explanation:** Multi-band compression allows you to compress the low end (kick/bass) tight without pumping the vocals or cymbals. It provides independent dynamic control over different frequency ranges.
---
### Topic: LUFS & LOUDNESS MEASUREMENT
**Q:** You measure -14.3 LUFS integrated. For -14 LUFS target, this is:
-     Too far off, remake entirely
- (CORRECT) Within acceptable tolerance
-     Completely wrong
-     Way too loud
**Explanation:** Integrated LUFS is the average loudness of the entire song from start to finish. Short-term LUFS measures a 3-second sliding window. Use Short-term to check specific loud sections (like the final chorus).
---
## Volume 9: Acoustics
### Topic: ABSORPTION FUNDAMENTALS
**Q:** 6-inch rockwool vs 2-inch rockwool at 125Hz:
-     Identical absorption
-     2-inch better
- (CORRECT) 6-inch significantly better
-     Neither works at 125Hz
**Explanation:** The Absorption Coefficient (α) ranges from 0 (perfect reflection) to 1 (perfect absorption). An open window has a coefficient of 1.0 because no sound returns.
---
### Topic: BASS TRAPS
**Q:** At what distance from corner does pressure drop to 70% of maximum?
- (CORRECT) λ/8 approximately
-     1 meter always
-     Corner pressure constant everywhere
-     No pressure variation
**Explanation:** Porous bass traps work by velocity absorption (friction). Resonant bass traps (membrane/Helmholtz) work by pressure absorption and are tuned to specific problem frequencies.
---
### Topic: MONITOR PLACEMENT
**Q:** Speakers too close to walls cause:
-     Perfect sound
-     No effect
-     Only treble boost
- (CORRECT) Bass buildup and comb filtering
**Explanation:** The listener and the two speakers should form an equilateral triangle (60 degrees at each corner). This ensures the stereo image is accurate and the phantom center is solid.
---
## Volume 10: Equipment
### Topic: MIDI CONTROLLERS & PAD CONTROLLERS
**Q:** Phantom power provides what current to condenser mics?
-     100 amps
-     No current
- (CORRECT) 10mA maximum typical
-     1000 amps
**Explanation:** Aftertouch (Channel Pressure) allows you to modulate a sound (e.g., add vibrato or open a filter) by pressing down harder on the keys *after* the initial strike. Polyphonic Aftertouch allows this per-key.
---
### Topic: SIGNAL FLOW & ROUTING
**Q:** What is signal flow?
-     Water flow
- (CORRECT) Order audio passes through devices/processors
-     Only electrical current
-     No such thing
**Explanation:** Signal flow describes the path audio takes. A standard insert chain processes signal in series (one after another), meaning the output of the EQ feeds the input of the Compressor.
---
### Topic: ROCK PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES
**Q:** Rock production emphasizes:
-     Removing all dynamics
-     Only bass
- (CORRECT) Natural feel and live energy
-     Pure silence
**Explanation:** Rock production focuses on capturing energy. Drums often use 'Room Mics' heavily compressed to create a massive, explosive sound (e.g., Led Zeppelin sounds).
