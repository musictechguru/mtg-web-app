#### BASIC Q7: You use a gate on a podcast to remove background noise. The speaker's quiet words are being cut off. What's wrong?
- **Correct Answer:** Threshold is set too high - quiet speech falling below it; lower threshold or adjust attack/release
- **Expert Explanation:** Threshold is the level setting at which distinct dynamic processing (compression, gating) begins.

#### BASIC Q8: What's the difference between a gate and an expander?
- **Correct Answer:** Gate silences completely below threshold; expander reduces gradually
- **Expert Explanation:** Threshold is the level setting at which distinct dynamic processing (compression, gating) begins.

#### BASIC Q9: "Hold time" on a gate controls what?
- **Correct Answer:** How long the gate stays open after signal drops below threshold before starting to close
- **Expert Explanation:** Threshold is the level setting at which distinct dynamic processing (compression, gating) begins.

#### BASIC Q10: You're trying to clean up a noisy vocal take with a gate. What's the risk of using gates on vocals?
- **Correct Answer:** Natural breathing, quiet consonants, and word endings may be cut off; gates work better on percussive sounds than sustained vocals
- **Expert Explanation:** Gates silence below a threshold.
