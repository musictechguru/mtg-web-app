    Q: What is 'Gain Staging'?
      [TRUE] Managing signal levels at every point in the audio chain to maximize quality and minimize noise/distortion
      [FAIL] Setting up a stage for a band
      [FAIL] Making everything as loud as possible
      [FAIL] Turning up the bass

    ID: v1_p6_t14_b_3

      [FAIL] It becomes clearer
      [FAIL] It loses bass
      [FAIL] Nothing

    ID: v1_p6_t14_b_4
    Q: What is the goal of 'Unity Gain' through a plugin chain?
      [TRUE] The output level should equal the input level, so bypassing the plugin doesn't result in a volume jump

    Q: Why does input gain matter for analog-modeled plugins (like a vintage compressor)?
      [TRUE] They are designed to react to a specific 'Sweet Spot' (usually -18dBFS). Driving them too hot causes unwanted muddy distortion

      [FAIL] No, clipping is permanent
      [FAIL] Yes, but only with EQ
      [FAIL] No, 32-bit makes it worse

    ID: v1_p6_t14_i_6

      [FAIL] It makes it louder
      [FAIL] It adds treble

    ID: v1_p6_t14_a_5
    Q: How does input level affect a Saturation/Distortion plugin?

      [FAIL] It only changes volume
      [FAIL] It changes pitch
      [FAIL] It does nothing

    ID: v1_p6_t14_a_6

    ID: v1_p6_t14_a_7

      [FAIL] At +6dBFS
      [FAIL] Never

    ID: v1_p6_t14_a_10
    Q: Why is RMS (Average) level more important than Peak level for gain staging analog emulations?

      [FAIL] Peak is inaccurate
      [FAIL] RMS is louder

    ID: v1_p6_t14_m_3

      [FAIL] First stage is analog
      [FAIL] Last stage is digital
      [FAIL] It isn't critical

    ID: v1_p6_t14_m_5
    Q: How can gain staging mitigate Aliasing in non-oversampled plugins?

    ID: v1_p6_t14_m_8

      [FAIL] It adds noise
      [FAIL] It lowers volume
      [FAIL] It adds reverb

    ID: v1_p6_t14_m_9
    Q: In a 16-channel analog summing mixer, volume builds up. Why might you drive the channels hard but turn the Master Output down?
