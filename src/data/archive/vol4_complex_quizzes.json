Set start point (beginning of wanted audio)\n4. Set end point (end of wanted audio)\n5. Crop/trim to selection\n\n**Why Important:**\n- Removes silence (saves memory, faster loading)\n- Removes unwanted sounds (breaths, noise, bleed)\n- Creates clean sample boundaries\n- Reduces file size\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Zoom in to sample level (see individual samples)\n- Don't cut too close (may create clicks)\n- Leave tiny bit of silence (3-10ms) before transient\n- Check fade-in/out needed after trim\n- Save original (non-destructive workflow)\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- Cutting too close to transient (creates click)\n- Removing natural decay (sample sounds unnatural)\n- Not checking for silence before first sound\n- Cutting in middle of waveform (creates DC offset)\n\n**Applications:** All sample editing, drum sample preparation, loop creation, vocal sample cleanup.\n\n---"

Detect: Check waveform (should be centered)\n2. Measure: Tools show DC offset value\n3. Remove: High-pass filter at 5-10Hz OR DC offset removal tool\n4. Verify: Waveform now centered\n\n**Detection:**\n- Visual: Waveform shifted up/down\n- Meters: DC offset measurement tool\n- Audio: Click when looping\n\n**Removal Methods:**\n- **DC Offset Removal Filter:** Dedicated tool (best, preserves audio)\n- **High-Pass Filter:** 5-10Hz HPF (simple, effective)\n- **Fade In/Out:** From/to zero (crude but works)\n\n**Professional Practice:** Always check for and remove DC offset before normalization, export, or loop creation.

Find suitable loop region (similar waveform at start/end)\n2. Set loop start point (zero crossing)\n3. Set loop end point (zero crossing, matching phase)\n4. Test loop (listen for clicks, timbral changes)\n5. Adjust as needed (crossfade if necessary)\n\n**Loop Types:**\n- **Forward:** Plays loop start \u2192 end, repeats\n- **Forward-Backward (Ping-Pong):** Plays forward then backward\n- **Backward:** Plays loop end \u2192 start (rare)\n\n**Loop Length:**\n- **Short (1-10ms):** Can create pitched tone/resonance\n- **Medium (10-500ms):** Standard sustain loops\n- **Long (500ms+):** Natural, evolving loops\n\n**Successful Loops:**\n- Zero crossings at both points\n- Matching waveform shapes\n- Similar spectral content\n- Correct phase relationship\n- Crossfade if needed (20-50ms)\n\n**Applications:**\n- Sustaining samples (strings, pads, organs)\n- Reducing sample length (shorter files)\n- Creating infinite sustain from short samples\n\n---\n\n*[Content continues in Part 3 with Multi-Sampling, Time-Stretching, and MIDI fundamentals]*"

In overlap: both layers play, crossfading\n\n**Crossfade Width:**\n- **Narrow (5-10 values):** More distinct layers, less smooth\n- **Medium (10-20 values):** Balanced, natural\n- **Wide (20-40 values):** Very smooth, less layer definition\n\n**Curves:**\n- **Linear:** Straight crossfade (can sound unnatural)\n- **Equal Power:** Maintains perceived loudness during crossfade\n- **Exponential:** More natural to human perception\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Eliminates abrupt switching between samples\n- More realistic dynamic response\n- Smoother playing experience\n- Professional sound quality\n\n**Applications:**\n- Piano (essential for realistic dynamics)\n- Strings (bow pressure variations)\n- Brass/Woodwinds (breath pressure)\n- Drums (stick velocity)\n\n---"

(most common)\n- **Random:** Computer randomly selects sample each hit\n- **Velocity-triggered:** Different samples at different velocities\n\n**Applications:**\n- **Drums:** Hi-hats, snares, toms (repeated hits)\n- **Guitar:** Strums, picks (each strum slightly different)\n- **Percussion:** Shakers, tambourine, claves\n- **Piano:** Soft repeated notes (subtle variation)\n- **Orchestral:** Staccato strings, woodwinds\n\n**Memory Impact:**\n- Round robin multiplies samples needed\n- 88 piano keys \u00d7 4 velocity layers \u00d7 6 round robins = 2,112 samples\n- Modern computers handle easily\n- Streaming from disk helps (not all in RAM)\n\n---"
