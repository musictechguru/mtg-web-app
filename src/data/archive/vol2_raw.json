Any noise introduced here gets amplified by everything downstream. Quality preamp essential for clean signal. Proper gain staging begins at this first stage.\n\n**Comparison:** Approximately 1000 times weaker than line level.

Full signal might overload preamp. Engage -20dB pad, then increase preamp gain to compensate. Result: clean signal without distortion.\n\n**Alternative Solutions:**\n- Move microphone farther from source (inverse square law)\n- Use less sensitive microphone (dynamic instead of condenser)\n- Reduce sound source volume (if possible)\n\n**Professional Practice:** Use pad when seeing preamp overload (distortion) even with gain at minimum.
