They mapped the tight synthesized bass riff over to heavily distorted, palm-muted electric guitars, and replaced programmed percussion with highly energetic live drum patterns. The syncopation (emphasis on the off-beats) is perfectly preserved, proving that strong rhythmic motifs can transcend instrumentation.",

Korn's cover translates this exact groove into Nu-Metal terminology. The 7-string guitars provide a massive wall of distortion, while bassist Fieldy replaces the original funk bass with his distinctive percussive, low-end metallic slap technique on a 5-string bass. The aggressive, growling vocal delivery finishes the genre transformation.",

                    "description": "\"Heartbreak Hotel\" (1956) is a blues-influenced rock and roll track recorded at RCA Studios in Nashville. The song features a sparse arrangement with Elvis on vocals, Scotty Moore on electric guitar, Bill Black on upright bass, DJ Fontana on drums, and Floyd Cramer on piano. The production is characterized by its heavy use of echo/reverb, creating a haunting, empty atmosphere that perfectly complements the lyrical theme of loneliness. The track was recorded using simple live studio techniques typical of the 1950s, with minimal overdubbing.",

'Humbucking' pickups, which use two coiled magnets wired out of phase to cancel out electrical noise, provided a much fatter, darker, and noise-free signal perfect for pushing Marshall stacks.</p><blockquote style=\"border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic;\">\"The humbucker gave the guitar the midrange punch required to stand up to a heavy drum kit.\"<br/><strong>- Hard Rock Engineer</strong></blockquote>",

Guitarists like Eddie Van Halen and brands like Ibanez or Jackson heavily modified Stratocaster designs.
