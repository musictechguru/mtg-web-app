The Talkbox allows him to articulate words while playing the precise {1} and harmony on the keyboard. Unlike a Vocoder, which combines two electronic signals internally, the Talkbox relies on the physical {2} of the performer's mouth to shape the frequency content. The result is monophonic and requires significant {3} to maintain intelligibility. In this track, the vocal texture is {4} and punchy, sitting atop a heavy synthesized bass groove, defining the {5} funk sound.",
