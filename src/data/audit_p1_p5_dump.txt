--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_a_9|Mute Groups|Correct: 96 vs Next: 16
  Q: What is the purpose of a 'Mute Group'?
  Correct: To mute a specific set of channels (e.g. all FX returns or all drums) with a single button press
  Distractors: ['To mute everyone', 'To group faders', 'To hide channels']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_a_10|Write vs Touch Automation|Correct: 102 vs Next: 25
  Q: What is the difference between 'Write' and 'Touch' automation modes?
  Correct: Write overwrites ALL data continuously (dangerous). Touch only writes while you are touching the fader
  Distractors: ['Write is for lyrics', 'Touch is for touchscreens', 'They are the same']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_1|Floating Point Mix Bus|Correct: 134 vs Next: 17
  Q: Why is it virtually impossible to 'clip' the internal mix bus of a 32-bit Floating Point DAW?
  Correct: The dynamic range is >1500dB. Values above 0dB are preserved, not truncated, so you can just turn the Master down to recover the audio
  Distractors: ['It is magic', 'It has a limiter', 'It clips at +10dB']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_2|Binaural Panning|Correct: 106 vs Next: 21
  Q: How does Binaural Panning differ from standard Stereo Panning?
  Correct: It uses HRTF (Head Related Transfer Functions) to simulate 3D position (front/back/up/down) for headphones
  Distractors: ['It is for two ears', 'It is just Left/Right', 'It adds echo']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_3|VCA vs Group Phase Issues|Correct: 130 vs Next: 17
  Q: Why might using an Audio Subgroup cause phase issues that a VCA does not?
  Correct: Audio Subgroups add a tiny processing delay (latency) which can comb-filter against the parallel dry signal; VCAs add zero latency
  Distractors: ['Groups are analog', 'VCAs are slower', "They don't"]
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_4|Inter-Sample Peaks|Correct: 101 vs Next: 19
  Q: Why can a meter reading -0.1dBFS still cause distortion on consumer playback?
  Correct: The analog reconstruction filter can overshoot the digital samples (Inter-Sample Peaks) exceeding 0dB
  Distractors: ['The meter is broken', 'Speakers vary', 'Compression']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_5|Automating Mute|Correct: 113 vs Next: 21
  Q: Why is automating a Mute button often considered bad practice vs automating the Fader?
  Correct: Mutes can cause clicks/pops if cut mid-wave, and they cut reverb tails unnaturally. Faders allow smooth fade outs
  Distractors: ["Mutes don't save", 'Faders use less CPU', "It isn't bad practice"]
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_6|Pan Law -4.5dB|Correct: 98 vs Next: 22
  Q: What is the characteristic of -4.5dB Pan Law?

  Distractors: ['It is for film', 'It is digital', 'It makes center louder']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_7|Trim Automation Mode|Correct: 126 vs Next: 25
  Q: What does 'Trim' automation mode (e.g. Volume Trim) do in Pro Tools?
  Correct: It adds a relative offset to existing automation moves (scaling them up/down) without overwriting the original intricate moves
  Distractors: ['It cuts the head and tail', 'It deletes automation', 'It normalizes']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_8|Summing Bus Headroom|Correct: 76 vs Next: 20
  Q: In analog summing, what determines the maximum number of channels before distortion?
  Correct: The voltage rail limits of the summing amplifier (Noise vs Distortion floor)
  Distractors: ['The number of faders', 'The cable size', 'The temperature']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t12_m_9|Dither on Fader|Correct: 108 vs Next: 22
  Q: When reducing fader volume on a 24-bit file, the word length effectively expands to 32/64-bit float. When does Dither need to be applied?
  Correct: Only at the very final output stage when converting back to a fixed bit depth (e.g. 24 or 16 bit) for export
  Distractors: ['On every channel fader', 'Never', 'Before compression']
--------------------

--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_b_2|Pre-Fader Definition|Correct: 102 vs Next: 33
  Q: What does 'Pre-Fader' mean?
  Correct: The signal is tapped BEFORE the fader, so moving the main volume fader has NO effect on the send level
  Distractors: ['The signal is tapped after the EQ', 'The signal is muted', 'It means before the preamp']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_b_3|Post-Fader Definition|Correct: 88 vs Next: 26
  Q: What does 'Post-Fader' mean?
  Correct: The signal is tapped AFTER the fader, so turning down the fader ALSO turns down the send
  Distractors: ['It is delayed', 'It goes to the post office', 'It is louder']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_b_6|Internal vs External|Correct: 75 vs Next: 14

  Distractors: ['Double the level', 'Half the level', 'None']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_b_10|Multiple Sends|Correct: 65 vs Next: 20
  Q: Can you use multiple Aux Sends on one channel?
  Correct: Yes, e.g. Send 1 to Reverb, Send 2 to Delay, Send 3 to Headphones
  Distractors: ['No, only one', 'Only if it is stereo', 'Only on drums']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_2|Pre-EQ vs Post-EQ|Correct: 64 vs Next: 15
  Q: By default, are most Aux Sends Pre-EQ or Post-EQ?
  Correct: Post-EQ (So if you brighten the vocal, the reverb brightens too)
  Distractors: ['Pre-EQ', 'Post-Fader only', 'They bypass EQ']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_3|Matrix Matrix|Correct: 122 vs Next: 20
  Q: What is a 'Matrix' output on a large console?

  Distractors: ['A billiard stick', 'A reverb setting', 'The final master']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_5|Return Channel|Correct: 115 vs Next: 23
  Q: Can you EQ an Aux Return?
  Correct: Yes, treating the Reverb itself as an audio source to shape its tone (e.g. cutting muddy lows from the reverb tail)
  Distractors: ['No, it is locked', 'Only with digital desks', 'Only volume']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_6|Send Pan|Correct: 109 vs Next: 16
  Q: What happens if you send a mono vocal to a Stereo Reverb but don't pan the Send?
  Correct: The reverb enters the center of the stereo space. Panning the send places the reverb excitation left or right
  Distractors: ['It stays mono', 'It breaks stereo', 'It sounds dry']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_7|Sidechain Key|Correct: 134 vs Next: 25
  Q: How do you use a Send to trigger a Compressor Sidechain (e.g. for Ducking)?
  Correct: Send the Kick Drum via a Pre-Fader bus to the 'Key Input' of the Bass compressor. No sound is heard from the bus, it is just a trigger
  Distractors: ['Send it to the main input', 'Use an insert', 'Use a group']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_8|Bus vs Aux|Correct: 107 vs Next: 18
  Q: What is the difference between a Bus and an Aux?
  Correct: A Bus is the 'wire/pathway' that carries the signal. An Aux is the 'control' that puts signal onto that bus
  Distractors: ['They are unrelated', 'Bus is for cars', 'Aux is for power']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_9|Latency in Returns|Correct: 129 vs Next: 19
  Q: Why is latency on an Aux Return (e.g. a sluggish digital reverb) less critical than latency on an insert?
  Correct: Because reverb IS delay. A few milliseconds of pre-delay on a reverb return sounds natural. On an insert (Dry), it causes phasing
  Distractors: ['It is more critical', 'It causes feedback', 'It adds treble']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_i_10|Prefade Listen safe|Correct: 102 vs Next: 12
  Q: Why effectively use PFL on an Aux Master?
  Correct: To solo the Reverb signal itself (100% Wet) to check for noise or tone, without hearing the dry source
  Distractors: ['To mute it', 'To bypass it', 'To delete it']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_1|Fader Flip|Correct: 126 vs Next: 30

  Distractors: ['It turns the fader upside down', 'It inverts polarity', 'It deletes the mix']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_2|Multing|Correct: 95 vs Next: 26
  Q: What is 'Multing' via a patchbay or routing?
  Correct: Duplicating a signal to multiple destinations (e.g. sending a vocal to 3 different compressors)
  Distractors: ['Adding treble', 'Using multiple microphones', 'Muting']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_3|Post-Pan Send|Correct: 104 vs Next: 22
  Q: Why use a 'Post-Pan' Aux Send for a stereo delay?
  Correct: So that if you pan the guitar left, the delay also appears on the left (maintaining spatial positioning)
  Distractors: ['It is louder', 'It creates a ping pong', 'It cancels the panning']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_4|N-1 (Mix Minus)|Correct: 118 vs Next: 23
  Q: What is an 'N-1' or 'Mix Minus' bus used for in broadcast?
  Correct: Sending a mix to a remote guest that typically contains the whole show MINUS their own voice (to prevent echo overlap)
  Distractors: ['Subtracting noise', 'Mixing negative numbers', 'Removing the host']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_5|Aux Subgrouping|Correct: 74 vs Next: 16
  Q: Why route multiple drum tracks to a Bus (Aux) before the Main Output?

--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_7|Print Track|Correct: 76 vs Next: 20
  Q: What involves routing your Mix Bus to an internal Audio Track instead of the Output?
  Correct: Creating a 'Manually Printed' mix file within the session (Real-time bounce)
  Distractors: ['Printing sheet music', 'Deleting the mix', 'Testing speakers']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_8|Direct Out|Correct: 99 vs Next: 17
  Q: What is a 'Direct Out' on a channel strip?
  Correct: A discreet output for that single channel alone, usually post-preamp, used for multitrack recording
  Distractors: ['The main mix out', 'The headphone out', 'A direct box']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_9|Pre-Insert Send|Correct: 81 vs Next: 20
  Q: Why might you want an Aux Send to be 'Pre-Insert'?
  Correct: To record the raw dry signal while monitoring through effects on the Insert point
  Distractors: ['To add distortion', 'To compress it first', 'It is impossible']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_a_10|Effect Throw|Correct: 96 vs Next: 17
  Q: What is a 'Delay Throw'?
  Correct: Automating the Aux Send un-mute for just one specific word (making it echo) then muting it again
  Distractors: ['Throwing the unit', 'A long delay', 'A broken delay']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_1|Parallel Compression Phase|Correct: 138 vs Next: 27
  Q: When doing analog parallel compression (multing), why must you be careful with digital effect units?
  Correct: Digital units add latency (A/D D/A conversion time). Combining this delayed signal with the analog dry signal causes severe comb filtering
  Distractors: ['Digital units are too clean', 'Analog is faster than light', 'It causes distortion']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_2|Stem Mixing|Correct: 117 vs Next: 19
  Q: What is the definition of 'Stems' in professional delivery?
  Correct: Printed stereo files of subgroups (e.g. Drums Stem, Vocal Stem, Music Stem) that sum perfectly to equal the final mix
  Distractors: ['The raw multitracks', 'Mono files', 'MP3s']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_3|Feedback Loop Equalization|Correct: 78 vs Next: 19

  Distractors: ['Classical composers', 'News anchors', 'Country singers']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_4|AFL Panning|Correct: 78 vs Next: 25
  Q: In AFL mode, does the solo bus respect the channel pan?
  Correct: Yes, AFL is stereo and follows the pan pot. PFL is typically mono and centered
  Distractors: ['No, both are mono', 'No, both are stereo', 'It depends on the weather']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_5|Send automation laws|Correct: 108 vs Next: 21
  Q: When muting a channel, why does a Post-Fader Send mute, but a Pre-Fader Send does not?
  Correct: Post-Fader logic dictates the send is tapped AFTER the mute block. Pre-Fader is tapped BEFORE the mute block
  Distractors: ["It's a bug", 'Pre-Fader has no mute', 'Magic']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_6|Sidechain Filtering|Correct: 126 vs Next: 28
  Q: Why filter the lows out of a Compressor Sidechain path?
  Correct: To prevent the heavy kick drum energy from triggering the compressor, allowing the mix to breathe while still compressing mids
  Distractors: ['To remove bass from the song', 'To make it faster', 'To distort']
--------------------
FLAGGED|p5|v1_p5_t13_m_7|Dante Routing|Correct: 36 vs Next: 12
