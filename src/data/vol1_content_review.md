**Goal:** Audit for Tone, Relevance, and Specialist Accuracy.

## Part: All Topics
### Topic: AUDIO FUNDAMENTALS
#### Q1: What is audio?
- **Correct Answer:** Vibrations traveling through air
- **Expert Explanation:** Audio vs Sound: Think of a live vocalist. Their voice is 'Sound' (air pressure). The signal flowing through the XLR cable to the mixer is 'Audio' (electricity).
- **Quote:** "We take these sound waves, this sound, and we organize it into emotion, and that's how we connect with our audiences." - Stefon Harris
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/waveform_time_domain.svg)

---

#### Q2: Frequency is measured in:
- **Correct Answer:** Hertz
- **Expert Explanation:** Hertz (Hz): Imagine a drummer hitting 100 beats per second—that would be a low hum at 100Hz. Frequency is just the speed of vibration.
- **Quote:** "Just trust your ears. You can hear as well as anyone else what sounds good and what doesn't." - Tape Op Magazine
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_frequency_v2.png)

---

#### Q3: What determines the pitch of a sound?
- **Correct Answer:** Frequency
- **Expert Explanation:** Pitch is perception. A 440Hz vibration is physics; we hear it as the musical note 'A4' (Middle A), the standard tuning reference for orchestras.
- **Quote:** "Sound is physical; audio is electrical. Know the difference." - Engineering 101
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/pitch_vs_frequency.svg)

---

#### Q4: Amplitude determines:
- **Correct Answer:** Loudness/volume of sound
- **Expert Explanation:** Amplitude is energy. Plucking a guitar string harder creates a larger physical vibration (amplitude), which we hear as a louder volume.
- **Quote:** "We don’t capture sound; we capture a representation of it." - Philosophy of Audio
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/amplitude_loudness.svg)

---

#### Q5: Human hearing range is approximately:
- **Correct Answer:** 20Hz to 20kHz
- **Expert Explanation:** 20Hz-20kHz: From the lowest sub-bass rumble of an 808 kick (30-60Hz) to the highest air of a vocal reverb (15kHz+), this is our musical canvas.
- **Quote:** "The 20Hz-20kHz range is our window to the sonic world. Anything outside is felt, not heard." - Acoustics 101
- **Image:** [Frequency Spectrum Diagram](/images/svg/human_hearing_range.svg)

---

#### Q6: A waveform shows:
- **Correct Answer:** Visual representation of sound over time
- **Expert Explanation:** Waveform: The visual 'shape' of sound. A smooth curve is a flute; a jagged, spiky line is a distorted guitar. We edit audio by looking at these shapes.
- **Quote:** "Trust your ears, but check your meters. Ears can be fooled; meters don’t lie... mostly." - Studio Wisdom
- **Image:** [Animated Waveform Diagram](/images/svg/waveform_phaser_anim.svg)

---

#### Q7: The unit for measuring sound pressure level is:
- **Correct Answer:** Decibels
- **Expert Explanation:** Decibels (dB): Our ears are logarithmic. To make a sound feel 'twice as loud', we need 10 times the power. That's why a 100W amp isn't 10x louder than a 10W amp.
- **Quote:** "Audio is the art of preserving an emotional moment in time." - Producer
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/dbfs_meter.svg)

---

#### Q8: What is a transient?
- **Correct Answer:** Short, sharp sound
- **Expert Explanation:** Transients: The initial 'crack' of a drum hit. In modern pop, we preserve these at all costs to keep the track punchy and rhythmic.
- **Quote:** "If it sounds good, it is good. But 'why' it sounds good is physics." - Joe Meek Rule
- **Image:** [Transient Waveform](/images/svg/transient_waveform_v2.svg)

---

#### Q9: Bass frequencies are:
- **Correct Answer:** Low frequencies
- **Expert Explanation:** Bass (20-250Hz): The foundation. In a club, this is the frequency range that physically moves your chest. Without it, music feels thin and weak.
- **Quote:** "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration." - Nikola Tesla
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/frequency_spectrum_bass.svg)

---

#### Q10: Treble frequencies are:
- **Correct Answer:** High frequencies
- **Expert Explanation:** Treble (4kHz+): The detail. This is where the 'air' lives. It defines the expensive sheen of a pop vocal or the shimmer of a cymbal.
- **Quote:** "We take these sound waves, this sound, and we organize it into emotion, and that's how we connect with our audiences." - Stefon Harris
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/frequency_spectrum_treble.svg)

---

### Topic: DECIBELS & DYNAMIC RANGE
#### Q1: What does dB stand for?
- **Correct Answer:** Decibel
- **Expert Explanation:** Decibels are relative. Saying '10dB' is like saying 'bigger'. Bigger than what? You always need a reference level (like 0dB or SPL).
- **Quote:** "If everything is loud, then nothing is loud; there is no loud without quiet." - Dynamic Range Principle
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/dbfs_meter.svg)

---

#### Q2: dBFS refers to:
- **Correct Answer:** Decibels Full Scale
- **Expert Explanation:** Dynamic Range: The gap between the noise floor (hiss) and distortion. In classical music, this gap is huge. In dubstep, it's tiny.
- **Quote:** "The preferred dynamic range of today might not be the same sound of tomorrow. And that's precisely what makes music so exciting." - eMastered
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/dynamic_range_concept.svg)

---

#### Q3: In digital audio, 0dBFS is:
- **Correct Answer:** Maximum level
- **Expert Explanation:** Clipping: When the wave hits the ceiling. In digital, it sounds like a nasty 'crack'. It breaks the illusion of reality instantly.
- **Quote:** "The decibel is relative. Always ask: 'Relative to what?'" - Metering Pro
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_clipping_v2.png)

---

#### Q4: What is clipping?
- **Correct Answer:** Distortion from signal too loud
- **Expert Explanation:** Noise Floor: The 'silence' of a studio isn't truly silent. There's always preamble hiss, air conditioning, and electrical buzz. We record above this 'floor'.
- **Quote:** "6dB is a doubling of amplitude. 10dB is a doubling of perceived loudness." - Psychoacoustics
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q5: Headroom means:
- **Correct Answer:** Space between peak level and maximum
- **Expert Explanation:** 0dBFS: The absolute limit of digital audio. Unlike analog tape which can be pushed into the red for warmth, digital just uglies up.
- **Quote:** "Silence is the canvas. Noise is the texture." - Ambient Composer
- **Image:** [Headroom Diagram](/images/svg/headroom_diagram.svg)

---

#### Q6: Dynamic range is:
- **Correct Answer:** Difference between quietest and loudest
- **Expert Explanation:** Headroom: The safety zone. If you record at -12dB, you leave room for the drummer to get excited and hit louder without ruining the take.
- **Quote:** "Dynamic range is the distance between the noise floor and the distortion point." - Technical Definition
- **Image:** [Dynamic Range](/images/svg/dynamic_range_concept.svg)

---

#### Q7: A good recording level peaks at approximately:
- **Correct Answer:** -12dBFS to -6dBFS
- **Expert Explanation:** Inverse Square Law: Move the mic 2x further back, lose -6dB of volume. This is why close-micing is so powerful for isolation.
- **Quote:** "Don't fight the logarithmic nature of hearing. Work with it." - Audio Science
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/amplitude_loudness.svg)

---

#### Q8: What happens when you clip in digital recording?
- **Correct Answer:** Distortion that cannot be fixed
- **Expert Explanation:** SPL (Sound Pressure Level): The physical loudness in the room. 85dB SPL is a safe mixing level. 120dB SPL damages your ears quickly.
- **Quote:** "Every bit of sound that can not be captured by the foreseen headroom will be distorted." - Quora Expert
- **Image:** [Clipping Waveform](/images/svg/clipping_waveform.svg)

---

#### Q9: 6dB of headroom means peaks are:
- **Correct Answer:** At -6dBFS
- **Expert Explanation:** Signal-to-Noise: We want high Signal (Music) and low Noise (Hiss). A ratio of 100dB is pro quality. Old cassettes had only 50dB (lots of hiss).
- **Quote:** "If everything is loud, then nothing is loud; there is no loud without quiet." - Dynamic Range Principle
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q10: Red lights on meters indicate:
- **Correct Answer:** Clipping
- **Expert Explanation:** Bass perception: At low volumes, bass disappears. This is why we mix at a consistent volume—to stop us from over-boosting the bass.
- **Quote:** "The preferred dynamic range of today might not be the same sound of tomorrow. And that's precisely what makes music so exciting." - eMastered
- **Image:** [Red Click Indicator](/images/svg/red_light_clipping.svg)

- **Quote:** "Dither is the lesser of two errors." - Bob Katz
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/sample_rate_dots.svg)

---

#### Q2: CD quality audio uses what sample rate?
- **Correct Answer:** 44.1kHz
- **Expert Explanation:** Nyquist Rule: You must sample twice as fast as the highest pitch you want to capture. To catch 20kHz, we need 40kHz+ speed.
- **Quote:** "Bit depth determines the dynamic range. 24-bit gives you a massive 144dB of range, essentially eliminating the noise floor." - Digital Audio Fact
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_nyquist_v2.png)

---

#### Q3: Higher sample rate means:
- **Correct Answer:** Higher frequency capture possible
- **Expert Explanation:** Bit Depth: The 'vertical' resolution. 8-bit is grainy (Nintendo). 16-bit is clean (CD). 24-bit is pristine (Studio).
- **Quote:** "Sample rate captures time. Bit depth captures amplitude." - Digital Mantra
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/quantization_steps.svg)

---

#### Q4: Bit depth determines:
- **Correct Answer:** Dynamic range
- **Expert Explanation:** CD Standard: 16-bit / 44.1kHz. Chosen in 1980 to fit Beethoven's 9th Symphony on a single disc. It remains the reference quality today.
- **Quote:** "Nyquist governs the speed limit of digital audio." - Theorem Fact
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_cd_specs_v2.png)

---

#### Q5: Modern recording uses what bit depth?
- **Correct Answer:** 24-bit
- **Expert Explanation:** Aliasing: An error where high frequencies fold back as ugly noise. It's why old samplers sounded 'crunchy'—they had bad anti-aliasing filters.
- **Quote:** "Jitter is the enemy of clarity. Keep your clock stable." - Clocking Advice
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_aliasing_v2.png)

---

#### Q6: A/D conversion means:
- **Correct Answer:** Analog to Digital
- **Expert Explanation:** MP3 Compression: Psychoacoustics in action. The MP3 algorithm says 'You can't hear this quiet sound after that loud cymbal crash', so it deletes it.
- **Quote:** "There are no steps in the analog waveform until we slice it." - ADC Concept
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_file_size_math_v2.png)

---

#### Q7: D/A conversion means:
- **Correct Answer:** Digital to Analog
- **Expert Explanation:** Quantization Error: The difference between the real smooth wave and the stepped digital version. It manifests as a low-level grit or fuzz.
- **Quote:** "Aliasing is audio ghosting. Filter it out before it haunts your mix." - DSP Engineer
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/quantization_steps.svg)

---

#### Q8: The Nyquist frequency is:
- **Correct Answer:** Half the sample rate
- **Expert Explanation:** Jitter: Digital timing errors. If the clock isn't steady, the audio blurs. Like a drummer with shaky timing.
- **Quote:** "Our ear can not distinguish the difference in the sound quality when we play the recordings with 44.1kHz and 192kHz sample rate." - Major Mixing
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_jitter_clock_v2.png)

---

#### Q9: Dithering is used when:
- **Correct Answer:** Reducing bit depth
- **Expert Explanation:** Dither: Mathematical noise. We add a tiny hiss to mask the ugly quantization distortion. It makes digital fade-outs sound smooth instead of glitchy.
- **Quote:** "Dither is the lesser of two errors." - Bob Katz
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/dither_concept.svg)

---

#### Q10: 48kHz sample rate can capture frequencies up to approximately:
- **Correct Answer:** 24kHz
- **Expert Explanation:** Latency: The echo caused by computer processing time. Lowering the buffer size reduces latency but works the CPU harder.
- **Quote:** "Bit depth determines the dynamic range. 24-bit gives you a massive 144dB of range, essentially eliminating the noise floor." - Digital Audio Fact
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_latency_buffer_v2.png)

---

### Topic: RECORDING CHAIN & SIGNAL PATH
#### Q1: The first stage in a recording chain is:
- **Correct Answer:** Sound source
- **Expert Explanation:** Chain: Microphones create tiny voltages. Preamps make them big. Converters make them digital. Computers record them. Learn this flow!
- **Quote:** "The signal chain is only as strong as its weakest link." - Common Adage
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/signal_chain_basic.svg)

---

#### Q2: A microphone converts:
- **Correct Answer:** Sound to electrical signal
- **Expert Explanation:** Transducers: The ears and mouth of the system. Mics (ears) and Speakers (mouths) are the only parts that actually move air.
- **Quote:** "The chain is: Source -> Room -> Mic -> Preamp -> Converter." - Signal Flow
- **Image:** [Dynamic Microphone Construction](/images/svg/mic_dynamic.svg)

---

#### Q3: Typical microphone output level is:

- **Expert Explanation:** DI Box: Essential for Bass Guitar. It changes the instrument's high-impedance signal into a mic-friendly signal so you can plug it into a stage snake.
- **Quote:** "Garbage in, garbage out. A bad source can't be fixed by a good preamp." - Golden Rule
- **Image:** [Signal Levels Chart](/images/svg/signal_levels_chart.svg)

---

#### Q4: What amplifies the weak microphone signal?
- **Correct Answer:** Preamp
- **Expert Explanation:** XLR: The 3-pin Lock. It carries Balanced Audio (hot, cold, ground). It's designed to be rugged and stepped on at gigs.
- **Quote:** "Short cables, clean power, good clock. The holy trinity of clean recording." - Setup Tip
- **Image:** [Microphone Preamp](/images/svg/microphone_preamp.svg)

---

#### Q5: Preamps typically add how much gain?
- **Correct Answer:** 30-60dB
- **Expert Explanation:** Mic vs Line: Mic signals are fragile and quiet. Line signals are robust and loud. Plugging a synth (Line) into a Mic input will distort horribly.
- **Quote:** "Every connector is a potential failure point." - Live Sound Law
- **Image:** [Preamp Gain Knob](/images/svg/preamp_gain.svg)

---

#### Q6: The A/D converter's job is to:
- **Correct Answer:** Convert analog to digital for recording
- **Expert Explanation:** Balanced Cables: Magic noise cancellation. They flip the signal phase on one wire, transmit it, then flip it back at the end, deleting any buzz picked up along the way.
- **Quote:** "Understand the path or you'll be lost in the noise." - Troubleshooting 101
- **Image:** [A/D Conversion Diagram](/images/svg/ad_converter_process.svg)

---

#### Q7: Signal flows through the chain in what direction?
- **Correct Answer:** Source → Mic → Preamp → A/D → Computer
- **Expert Explanation:** Phantom Power: +48V electricity sent UP the mic cable to power the circuitry in condenser mics. Dynamic mics (SM58) just ignore it.
- **Quote:** "If something isn't working right, think about where in the signal flow your problem might be." - Troubleshooting Rule
- **Image:** [Recording Signal Flow](/images/svg/recording_signal_flow.svg)

---

#### Q8: Each stage in the chain can add:
- **Correct Answer:** Noise and affect quality
- **Expert Explanation:** ADAT Lightpipe: That square optical port on your interface? It lets you add 8 more mic preamps via a single fiber-optic cable.
- **Quote:** "The signal chain is only as strong as its weakest link." - Common Adage
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_spdif_connectors_v2.png)

---

#### Q9: The weakest link in the chain determines:
- **Correct Answer:** Overall quality
- **Expert Explanation:** Hi-Z Input: The 'Instrument' jack. If you plug a guitar into a regular Line input, it sounds dull and muddy. Hi-Z acts like a guitar amp input.
- **Quote:** "The chain is: Source -> Room -> Mic -> Preamp -> Converter." - Signal Flow
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_di_box_flow_v2.png)

---

#### Q10: D/A conversion is needed for:
- **Correct Answer:** Playback through speakers/headphones
- **Expert Explanation:** Patchbay: The switchboard. Instead of crawling behind the rack to change cables, you use short patch cords on the front panel.
- **Quote:** "Garbage in, garbage out. A bad source can't be fixed by a good preamp." - Golden Rule
- **Image:** [D/A Conversion Diagram](/images/svg/da_converter_process.svg)

---

### Topic: GAIN STAGING IN RECORDING
#### Q1: Gain staging means:
- **Correct Answer:** Setting optimal levels at each stage
- **Expert Explanation:** Gain Staging: The art of levels. Aim for the 'Goldilocks zone'—hot enough to be clean, but not so hot that you distort or clip.
- **Quote:** "Proper gain staging means the level of the signal is optimized throughout the entire signal chain." - Audio University
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q2: Where should you start when setting recording levels?
- **Correct Answer:** Microphone preamp
- **Expert Explanation:** Unity Gain (0 U): The sweet spot on a fader. It means 'Input = Output'. Your gear sounds best and has the most resolution here.
- **Quote:** "Yellow is the new Red in digital gain staging." - Modern Mixing
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q3: When setting preamp gain, the performer should:
- **Correct Answer:** Play their loudest part
- **Expert Explanation:** Red Lights: The enemy. In digital recording, a red clip light means data loss. Back off the preamp gain until the light stays green/yellow.
- **Quote:** "Clip once, distort forever." - Digital Warning
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_clipping_v2.png)

---

#### Q4: What should you watch when setting gain?
- **Correct Answer:** Input meter on interface/DAW
- **Expert Explanation:** -18dBFS: The new 'Zero'. Modern digital plugins are designed to sound best when the average level bumps around -18dBFS, not 0dBFS.
- **Quote:** "Structure your gain so faders can sit at unity." - Console Workflow
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/headroom_diagram.svg)

---

#### Q5: Good recording peaks should be around:
- **Correct Answer:** -12dBFS to -6dBFS
- **Expert Explanation:** Volume vs Gain: Gain happens at the START (Preamp sensitivity). Volume happens at the END (Fader/Amp output). Turn up gain for tone, volume for loudness.
- **Quote:** "Microphone level needs a 60dB boost. Line level needs respect." - Preamp basics
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q6: How much headroom should you leave?
- **Correct Answer:** 6dB above peaks
- **Expert Explanation:** Monitoring Volume: Don't mix loudly! Your ears compress sound at high volumes, fooling you into thinking the bass is massive when it isn't.
- **Quote:** "Headroom is freedom." - Dynamic Range Enthusiast
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q7: If your levels are too quiet:
- **Correct Answer:** Increases noise floor
- **Expert Explanation:** PPM vs VU: PPM (Peak) meters jump fast to show clipping. VU (Volume Unit) meters move slow to show perceived loudness/energy.
- **Quote:** "Gain Staging is all about maximizing SNR (Signal To Noise Ratio) and preventing unmusical distortion." - Mixing Advice
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/headroom_diagram.svg)

---

#### Q8: If your levels are too loud:
- **Correct Answer:** Clipping/distortion
- **Expert Explanation:** Hiss Management: If you record a quiet whisper with low gain, then boost it later, you boost the hiss too. Record it hot (cleanly) at the source.
- **Quote:** "Proper gain staging means the level of the signal is optimized throughout the entire signal chain." - Audio University
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q9: Recording at -18dBFS average provides:
- **Correct Answer:** Good headroom
- **Expert Explanation:** Fader Scale: Faders are logarithmic. Moving 1cm at the top changes volume slightly (fine control). Moving 1cm at the bottom cuts it to silence.
- **Quote:** "Yellow is the new Red in digital gain staging." - Modern Mixing
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/snr_concept.svg)

---

#### Q10: The goal of gain staging is:

- **Quote:** "There is no one ideal way to place a microphone. Whatever method sounds right is right." - Shure Application Engineers
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

#### Q2: Close micing provides:
- **Correct Answer:** Maximum isolation, less room acoustics
- **Expert Explanation:** Condenser Mic: The detailer (e.g., Rode NT1). Needs +48V Phantom Power. Captures the 'air' and breath in a voice. Studio standard.
- **Quote:** "Microphone placement is the EQ of recording. Move the mic before you reach for a plugin." - Recording Mantra
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

#### Q3: Proximity effect is:
- **Correct Answer:** Bass boost when mic is close to source
- **Expert Explanation:** Polar Pattern: The mic's listening shape. Omni hears all around (360). Cardioid hears only the front (Heart shape). Figure-8 hears front/back.
- **Quote:** "The best EQ is moving the microphone." - Al Schmitt
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

#### Q4: Distance micing (1-15 feet) provides:
- **Correct Answer:** More natural sound, room acoustics
- **Expert Explanation:** Proximity Effect: Step close to a Cardioid mic, and the bass boosts. It's the 'Movie Trailer Voice' effect. Step back to thin the sound out.
- **Quote:** "Inches make miles of difference in tone." - Placement Tip
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/proximity_graph.svg)

---

#### Q5: The 3:1 rule states:

- **Expert Explanation:** Ribbon Mic: The warmth machine. Uses a delicate metal ribbon. It smooths out harsh guitars and brass. Very fragile—don't blow on it!
- **Quote:** "Listening to the room is step one of microphone placement." - Acoustic Awareness
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

#### Q6: The 3:1 rule helps prevent:
- **Correct Answer:** Phase cancellation between mics
- **Expert Explanation:** Diaphgram Size: Large Diaphragm = Big, warm vocal sound. Small Diaphragm = Accurate, fast cymbal/acoustic guitar sound.
- **Quote:** "Get it right at the source. Fix it in the mix is a lie." - Production Truth
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

#### Q7: When should you check phase?
- **Correct Answer:** When using multiple microphones
- **Expert Explanation:** Pop Shield: A nylon mesh placed before the mic. It breaks up the air blast from 'P' and 'B' sounds (plosives) that would otherwise thump the recording.
- **Quote:** "A great performance on an SM57 beats a bad performance on a U47." - Gear vs Talent
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/proximity_graph.svg)

---

#### Q8: If adding a second mic makes sound thinner:
- **Correct Answer:** Possible phase issue
- **Expert Explanation:** Cardioid Pattern: Named after 'Cardiac' (Heart). It rejects sound from the rear. This is why stage monitors are placed behind the singer's mic.
- **Quote:** "The room is the most important consideration in mic placement. Even the best mic in a bad room will sound bad." - iZotope
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

#### Q9: The golden rule of mic placement is:
- **Correct Answer:** Listen first, place where it sounds best
- **Expert Explanation:** Figure-8: Bi-directional. Perfect for a duet facing each other, or specialized stereo techniques. Completely deaf to the sides (90°).
- **Quote:** "There is no one ideal way to place a microphone. Whatever method sounds right is right." - Shure Application Engineers
- **Image:** [Piano Mic Placement](/images/svg/mic_placement_piano.svg)

---

#### Q10: Small movements of a microphone:
- **Correct Answer:** Make big changes in tone
- **Expert Explanation:** Shockmount: The suspension cradle. It isolates the mic from floor vibrations. Without it, tapping your foot gets recorded as a low thump.
- **Quote:** "Microphone placement is the EQ of recording. Move the mic before you reach for a plugin." - Recording Mantra
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mics_v2.png)

---

### Topic: STEREO RECORDING & PHASE
#### Q1: Stereo recording uses how many microphones minimum?
- **Correct Answer:** 2 microphones
- **Expert Explanation:** Stereo Image: The phantom stage. By panning L and R, we create a virtual space. A good mix feels 3D, not just a bunch of mono sounds.
- **Quote:** "A mono-compatible mix isn't as important as it once was, but neither is it something you can ignore." - Mike Levine
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/stereo_field.svg)

---

#### Q2: Stereo recording captures:

- **Quote:** "Coincident pairs give you image. Spaced pairs give you width." - Stereo Theory
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/stereo_field.svg)

---

#### Q5: The phase invert button:
- **Correct Answer:** Flips signal 180°
- **Expert Explanation:** Mid-Side (M/S): One Cardioid (Mid) + One Figure-8 (Side). Allows you to control the WIDTH of the recording after you've captured it. Magic.
- **Quote:** "The 3:1 rule isn't magic, it's math." - Physics Fact
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mid_side_v2.png)

---

#### Q6: If sound gets thinner when combining two mics:
- **Correct Answer:** Possible phase cancellation
- **Expert Explanation:** Mono Check: Always press the MONO button. If your huge guitar sound disappears, you have phase cancellation. Listeners on phones/radios will hear silence.
- **Quote:** "Width comes from difference. If L and R are identical, you have mono." - Spatial Logic
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/phase_cancellation.svg)

---

#### Q7: Phase issues are most common with:
- **Correct Answer:** Multiple mics on same source
- **Expert Explanation:** Panning Laws: The Pan knob. Don't be afraid to go Hard Left/Right. Width comes from contrast—things in the middle vs things on the edge.
- **Quote:** "Microphone placement is one of the most critical factors in avoiding phase cancellation." - Mastering Box
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/svg/stereo_field.svg)

---

#### Q8: Time alignment means:
- **Correct Answer:** Aligning waveforms of multiple mics
- **Expert Explanation:** Decca Tree: 3 Omni mics in a T-shape. Invented by Decca Records. It's the sound of every John Williams film score (Star Wars, etc).
- **Quote:** "A mono-compatible mix isn't as important as it once was, but neither is it something you can ignore." - Mike Levine
- **Image:** ["Diagram"](/images/diagram_mid_side_v2.png)

---

#### Q9: Checking phase is done by:
