--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t4_b_2

--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t4_b_5
    Content: What does a high-pass filter do?

--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t5_b_6

    Q ID: v3_t5_b_7
    Content: For a pad sound with a long tail after releasing the key, what should the Release time be?

--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t6_b_4

--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t6_b_5
    Content: What creates tremolo in a synthesizer?

--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t6_b_8
    Content: What is PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)?

    Content: True or False: Granular synthesis creates a grainy, textured quality, especially with small grain sizes.
    Explanation: Clouds: Overlapping many grains creates a dense 'cloud' of sound. It smoothes out the transients into a wash.

  Topic ID: v3_t10, Title: PHYSICAL MODELING & SAMPLING
    Q ID: v3_t10_b_1
    Content: What is physical modeling synthesis?
    Explanation: Physical Modeling: Using math equations to simulate real physics (mass, tension, air pressure) rather than playing back a recording.

    Q ID: v3_t10_b_4
    Content: True or False: Sampling can recreate realistic acoustic instruments because it uses recordings of real instruments.
    Explanation: Sampling Realism: Very high. Because it IS a recording. The challenge is making it expressive (velocity layers, round robins).

    Q ID: v3_t10_b_5
    Content: What is multisampling?

    Q ID: v3_t10_b_8
    Content: What is Kontakt?
    Explanation: Kontakt: The industry standard engine. It allows scripting (Legato scripts) to make samples behave like real instruments.

--------------------
    Q ID: v3_t10_b_10
    Content: True or False: Physical modeling can simulate how an instrument behaves when played differently (like changing bow pressure on a violin).
    Explanation: Sampling vs Synthesis: Sampling captures a moment. Synthesis creates a moment. Sampling is static; Synthesis is dynamic.
