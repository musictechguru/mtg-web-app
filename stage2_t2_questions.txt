Total questions: 20
--- Question 1: Q_title=Q1: Question 5 ---
Content: True or False: Gain and volume are exactly the same thing.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: Gain affects the input tone and saturation (pre-processing). Volume affects how loud the final signal is heard (post-processing) without changing its character.

Quote: Drive the input, trim the output.

--- Question 2: Q_title=Q2: Question 5 ---
Content: True or False: You can damage a ribbon microphone by sending it phantom power.
Correct Answer: True
Expert Explanation: While modern ribbons are safer, vintage ribbon mics can be instantly destroyed if phantom power flows through them incorrectly (e.g. via patch bay shorts).

Quote: Save a ribbon, check the phantom.

--- Question 3: Q_title=Q3: Question 5 ---
Content: True or False: An omnidirectional microphone is best for isolating one sound source from others.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: Omni mics are terrible for isolation because they pick up room noise, computer fans, and other instruments from every angle.

Quote: Don't use Omni if you want separation.

------------------

--- Question 4: Q_title=Q4: Question 4 ---
Content: If a microphone is 4 inches from a snare drum, how far away should the next microphone be (minimum)?
Correct Answer: 12 inches
Expert Explanation: If Mic A is 4 inches from the snare, Mic B must be at least 12 inches (3 x 4) away to prevent phase cancellation.

Quote: Good production is like a beautiful marriage. It makes a happy home.

------------------

--- Question 5: Q_title=Q5: Question 4 ---
Content: True or False: You should always remove the front head of a kick drum or cut a hole in it for recording.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: A ported front head (with a hole) dries out the sound and makes mic placement easier, but a solid head has more vintage resonance.
Image: /images/explanations/mic_placement_kick.png
Quote: The hole is a port. It changes the resonance.

------------------

--- Question 6: Q_title=Q6: Question 3 ---
Content: True or False: Placing a microphone directly at the sound hole of an acoustic guitar always gives the best tone.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: Putting a mic in the soundhole creates a 'boomy', resonant mess. It's like listening inside a seashell—all standing waves.

Quote: Don't look into the eye of the storm.

------------------

--- Question 7: Q_title=Q7: Question 5 ---
Content: True or False: The same microphone setup works perfectly for both studio and live vocal situations.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: False. Studio vocals usually use sensitive Condensers. Live vocals use rugged Dynamics (like SM58s) to handle handling noise and prevent feedback.

Quote: Mastering is the final creative step in the record making chain and the first step in the manufacturing process. The purpose of creative mastering is to enhance as much of the musicality that is inherent in the master mixes we are given.

------------------

--- Question 8: Q_title=Q8: Question 2 ---
Content: True or False: You should point a microphone directly at the bell of a trumpet for the best sound.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: Brass instruments can produce massive SPL. Use the Pad switch (-10dB or -20dB) to prevent clipping the preamp.

Quote: I'm an engineer, basically. There are different kinds of producers and there's room for all of them. Different artists require different things.

------------------

--- Question 9: Q_title=Q9: Question 3 ---
Content: True or False: You record an upright piano the same way as a grand piano.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: The lid of the piano reflects high frequencies outward. Removing it or closing it changes the tone drastically.

Quote: Mastering this concept takes practice.

------------------

--- Question 10: Q_title=Q10: Question 3 ---
Content: True or False: M/S stereo technique uses two cardioid microphones.
Correct Answer: False
Expert Explanation: ORTF mimics human hearing: Cardioid mics spaced 17cm apart at 110 degrees. It offers a good compromise between width and mono compatibility.
Image: /images/svg/stereo_ortf_diagram.svg
Quote: Know your polar patterns for M/S.

------------------

--- Question 11: Q_title=Q11: Question 5 ---
Content: What is the difference between clipping at the preamp stage versus clipping in the digital domain (DAW)?
Correct Answer: Preamp clipping can add harmonics
Expert Explanation: Gain staging is critical.

Quote: Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them as triggers for experiences.

------------------

--- Question 12: Q_title=Q12: Question 4 ---
Content: You want to record very detailed, accurate high-frequency content from cymbals. Which microphone should you choose?
Correct Answer: Small diaphragm condenser
Expert Explanation: Condensers capture high-frequency detail and transients accurately.

Quote: Music is the soul of the universe. It connects us all on a level that words alone cannot reach.

------------------

--- Question 13: Q_title=Q13: Question 9 ---
Content: You have a microphone with switchable patterns (omni, cardioid, figure-8). For recording in an untreated, reverberant room, which pattern provides the most isolation?
Correct Answer: Cardioid
Expert Explanation: Cardioid pattern rejects sound from the rear, making it ideal for live use.

Quote: Small improvements lead to big results.

------------------

--- Question 14: Q_title=Q14: Question 4 ---
Content: Why is distance micing less suitable for multi-tracking in an untreated room?
Correct Answer: Captures too much room ambience
Expert Explanation: Mic placement is the most powerful EQ.

Quote: My job was to get a balance and be invisible, to be a servant of the music and provide the technology to establish an emotional connection between the musicians and audience.

------------------

--- Question 15: Q_title=Q15: Question 5 ---
Content: You're micing toms and want a full, resonant sound. Where should you position the mics?
Correct Answer: 1-2 inches above the head
Expert Explanation: Drums require careful multi-mic phase alignment.

Quote: Musicians today can't go all the way with the music because they haven't done their homework with the left brain.

------------------

--- Question 16: Q_title=Q16: Question 3 ---
Content: You want to capture both the attack and body of an acoustic guitar in stereo. Which dual-mic approach works well?
Correct Answer: One at 12th fret for balance
Expert Explanation: Attack is the time it takes for the processor to react to the input signal.

Quote: Where words fail, music speaks.

------------------

--- Question 17: Q_title=Q17: Question 9 ---
Content: What is the advantage of using an omnidirectional pattern for vocals in a well-treated studio?
Correct Answer: More natural sound
Expert Explanation: The proximity effect boosts bass frequencies when the source is close to a directional mic.

Quote: I have camped in front of an E-series SSL since it came out in 1985, and I don't think SSL have since improved on the concept of that console.

------------------

--- Question 18: Q_title=Q18: Question 7 ---
Content: What distance is typical for micing wind instruments to achieve a natural, balanced sound?
Correct Answer: 6-12 inches to 2 feet
Expert Explanation: Balanced connections cancel out noise interference using phase inversion on the cold wire.
Image: /images/svg/kick_in_out_mic.svg
Quote: There is nothing better than the sound of a drum kit in an empty room.

------------------

--- Question 19: Q_title=Q19: Question 6 ---
Content: What's a common stereo technique for classical piano recording?
Correct Answer: ORTF or spaced pair
Expert Explanation: Pianos cover the full frequency spectrum.

Quote: You have to trust your instincts. If something is bothering me, I'll say so.

------------------

--- Question 20: Q_title=Q20: Question 6 ---
Content: A Blumlein pair uses two figure-8 microphones. What angle should they be positioned at?
Correct Answer: 90°
Expert Explanation: Figure-8 picks up front and back, rejecting sides. Great for ribbons.

Quote: Terms like figure-8 are fundamental.
