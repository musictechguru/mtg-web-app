--- Question 1: Q_title=Q1: Question 5 ---
Content: Human hearing range is approximately:
Correct Answer: 20 Hz to 20 kHz
Expert Explanation: 20Hz-20kHz is the standard human hearing range. We feel 20Hz as a rumble, and we sense 20kHz as 'air' or brilliance. We lose high-frequency hearing as we age.

Quote: The 20Hz-20kHz range is our window to the sonic world. Anything outside is felt, not heard.

------------------

--- Question 2: Q_title=Q2: Question 9 ---
Content: 6dB of headroom means peaks are:
Correct Answer: At -6dBFS
Expert Explanation: Signal-to-Noise: We want high Signal (Music) and low Noise (Hiss). A ratio of 100dB is pro quality. Old cassettes had only 50dB (lots of hiss).

Quote: If everything is loud, then nothing is loud; there is no loud without quiet.

------------------

--- Question 3: Q_title=Q3: Question 10 ---
Content: 48kHz sample rate can capture frequencies up to approximately:
Correct Answer: 24kHz
Expert Explanation: Latency: The echo caused by computer processing time. Lowering the buffer size reduces latency but works the CPU harder.

Quote: I'm just trying to make my favorite music. That's how I work; I just do things based on the way they feel to me. I want to be touched by the music I'm making.

------------------

--- Question 4: Q_title=Q4: Question 5 ---
Content: Preamps typically add how much gain?
Correct Answer: 30-60dB
Expert Explanation: Mic vs Line: Mic signals are fragile and quiet. Line signals are robust and loud. Plugging a synth (Line) into a Mic input will distort horribly.

Quote: Every connector is a potential failure point.

------------------

--- Question 5: Q_title=Q5: Question 9 ---
Content: Recording at -18dBFS average provides:
Correct Answer: Good headroom
Expert Explanation: Fader Scale: Faders are logarithmic. Moving 1cm at the top changes volume slightly (fine control). Moving 1cm at the bottom cuts it to silence.

Quote: Yellow is the new Red in digital gain staging.

------------------

--- Question 6: Q_title=Q6: Question 2 ---
Content: Close micing provides:
Correct Answer: Maximum isolation
Expert Explanation: Condenser Mic: The detailer (e.g., Rode NT1). Needs +48V Phantom Power. Captures the 'air' and breath in a voice. Studio standard.
Image: /images/svg/phantom_power.svg
Quote: Microphone placement is the EQ of recording. Move the mic before you reach for a plugin.

------------------

--- Question 7: Q_title=Q7: Question 1 ---
Content: Stereo recording uses how many microphones minimum?
Correct Answer: 2 microphones
Expert Explanation: Stereo Image: The phantom stage. By panning L and R, we create a virtual space. A good mix feels 3D, not just a bunch of mono sounds.

Quote: A mono-compatible mix isn't as important as it once was, but neither is it something you can ignore.

------------------

--- Question 8: Q_title=Q8: Question 1 ---
Content: Pre-production planning includes:
Correct Answer: Song arrangement
Expert Explanation: Pre-production: The 'Ghost' Phase. Fixing the song BEFORE you hit record. Tempo maps, rehearsing, key changes. A saved hour here saves days later.

Quote: Label your tracks. Future you will thank present you.

------------------

--- Question 9: Q_title=Q9: Question 4 ---
Content: Standard modern bit depth is:
Correct Answer: 24-bit
Expert Explanation: 24-bit Standard: Modern interfaces record at 24-bit. This provides a huge dynamic range (144dB), meaning you don't have to record super hot to avoid noise.
Image: /images/svg/bit_depth_range.svg
Quote: Record at 24-bit. Always.

------------------

--- Question 10: Q_title=Q10: Question 6 ---
Content: XLR cables have how many pins?
Correct Answer: 3 pins
Expert Explanation: Pinout: Pin 1 Ground, Pin 2 Hot (+), Pin 3 Cold (-). The Hot and Cold carry the audio; the Ground creates the shield.

Quote: XLR: The industry standard since the 1950s.

------------------

--- Question 11: Q_title=Q11: Question 4 ---
Content: The fundamental frequency of a note is 440Hz. The second harmonic is:
Correct Answer: 880Hz
Expert Explanation: Harmonics: The 'flavor' ingredients. A pure sine wave has no harmonics (bland). A distorted guitar has thousands of harmonics (spicy/rich).
Image: /images/svg/eq_bell_q_factor.svg
Quote: We don’t capture sound; we capture a representation of it.

------------------

--- Question 12: Q_title=Q12: Question 1 ---
Content: Doubling acoustic power increases SPL by:
Correct Answer: 3dB
Expert Explanation: Power Doubling: +3dB. It takes double the amplifier watts to get just +3dB of volume. To get +10dB (perceived double volume), you need 10x the watts!

Quote: If everything is loud, then nothing is loud; there is no loud without quiet.

------------------

--- Question 13: Q_title=Q13: Question 2 ---
Content: Sample rate of 48kHz can accurately capture frequencies up to:
Correct Answer: 24kHz
Expert Explanation: Bitrate: CD is 1411 kbps. Spotify High Quality is 320 kbps. We throw away 75% of the data, yet it sounds remarkably close.
Image: /images/svg/sample_rate_dots.svg
Quote: I never decide if an idea is good or bad until I try it.

------------------

--- Question 14: Q_title=Q14: Question 8 ---
Content: Phantom power voltage appears between:
Correct Answer: Pins 2 and 3
Expert Explanation: TRS Applications: TRS can be Balanced Mono (Line interconnect) OR Unbalanced Stereo (Headphones). The cable looks the same, but the usage differs!
Image: /images/svg/phantom_power.svg
Quote: The signal chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

------------------

--- Question 15: Q_title=Q15: Question 1 ---
Content: Microphone output is -55dBu. With 45dB preamp gain, output is:
Correct Answer: -10dBu
Expert Explanation: Gain Staging: The cumulative effect. If every track is 1dB too hot, the master bus will be +20dB overloaded. Start conservative.
Image: /images/svg/preamp_gain.svg
Quote: Proper gain staging means the level of the signal is optimized throughout the entire signal chain.

------------------

--- Question 16: Q_title=Q16: Question 10 ---
Content: Polarity reverse (phase flip) rotates signal by:
Correct Answer: 180°
Expert Explanation: Boundary / PZM Mic: Mounts to a flat surface (wall/floor). Uses the 'Pressure Zone' to eliminate phase reflections, capturing clear room tone.
Image: /images/Dictiionary_Quiz_image_Pool/Logic's Phase 2.png
Quote: Microphone placement is the EQ of recording. Move the mic before you reach for a plugin.

------------------

--- Question 17: Q_title=Q17: Question 6 ---
Content: Haas effect (precedence) occurs when delay is:
Correct Answer: 1-40ms
Expert Explanation: LCR Mixing: Left-Center-Right only. No 50% panning. Forces strong arrangement choices. The secret to massive, uncluttered rock mixes.
Image: /images/Dictiionary_Quiz_image_Pool/haas_effect_visual.svg
Quote: Width comes from difference. If L and R are identical, you have mono.

------------------

--- Question 18: Q_title=Q18: Question 6 ---
Content: At 96kHz, 256 sample buffer equals:
Correct Answer: 2.67ms
Expert Explanation: Latentcy Free Monitoring: Giving the artist the analog signal before it hits the computer. Vital for rappers/drummers where timing is everything.

Quote: Label your tracks. Future you will thank present you.

------------------

--- Question 19: Q_title=Q19: Question 8 ---
Content: ADAT optical at 44.1kHz carries:
Correct Answer: 8 channels
Expert Explanation: Class-A Preamps: Discrete, high-voltage circuitry. Sounds huge and warm compared to the generic Integrated Circuit (IC) chips in cheap gear.

Quote: This topic connects directly to better mixing and recording.

------------------

--- Question 20: Q_title=Q20: Question 9 ---
Content: Angle between speakers at listening position should be:
Correct Answer: 60°
Expert Explanation: Ribbon Tweeters: Use a folded metal ribbon instead of a dome. Ultra-fast transient response and very smooth high end (non-fatiguing).
Image: /images/explanations/fast_attack_transient_loss.svg
Quote: Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular.
