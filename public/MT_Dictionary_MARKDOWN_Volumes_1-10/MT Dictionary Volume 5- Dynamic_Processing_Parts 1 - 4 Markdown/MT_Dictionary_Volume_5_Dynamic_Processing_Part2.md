## 3. Advanced Compression Techniques

### Parallel Compression (New York Compression)
**Blending heavily compressed signal with dry uncompressed signal.**

**Concept:**
1. Original signal sent to two paths
2. Path 1: Dry, uncompressed (natural dynamics)
3. Path 2: Heavily compressed (10-20dB reduction, aggressive)
4. Both paths mixed together
5. Result: punch of dry + power of compressed

**Setup:**
- **Aux send method:** Send to aux track with compressor, blend
- **Duplicate track:** Duplicate, compress copy, blend
- **Parallel knob:** Some compressors have built-in dry/wet blend

**Compression Settings for Parallel:**
- **Ratio:** 10:1 or higher (very aggressive)
- **Threshold:** Low (lots of compression, 15-20dB reduction)
- **Attack:** Fast to medium (1-20ms)
- **Release:** Medium to fast (50-200ms)
- **Makeup Gain:** Bring up to match dry signal

**Blend Ratio:**
- Dry: 70-90%
- Compressed: 10-30%
- Adjust to taste (more compressed = more power, less dynamics)

**Why It Works:**
- Preserves transients (dry signal)
- Adds thickness and sustain (compressed signal)
- Best of both worlds (dynamic + powerful)
- Natural + controlled

**Applications:**
- **Drums:** Classic use (especially famous on drum room mics)
- **Vocals:** Powerful but natural
- **Bass:** Thick but dynamic
- **Mix bus:** Subtle glue without over-compression

**Famous Example:** Chris Lord-Alge (engineer) popularized in 1980s-90s. Called "New York Compression" due to NYC studio origins.

### Serial Compression (Stacked/Multiple)
**Using multiple compressors in series (one after another) with gentle settings.**

**Concept:**
- Compressor 1: First stage (3-4dB reduction)
- Compressor 2: Second stage (3-4dB reduction)
- Total: 6-8dB reduction, but smoother than single compressor

**Why Multiple Compressors:**
- Each compressor works less hard
- More transparent (smaller gain reduction per stage)
- Different characters combine
- More natural than heavy single compression

**Typical Chain:**
- **Stage 1:** Fast compressor (FET) - control peaks (2-3dB)
- **Stage 2:** Smooth compressor (optical) - even out body (3-4dB)
- **Stage 3:** Final glue (VCA on mix bus) - final control (1-2dB)

**Common Combinations:**
- **1176 → LA-2A:** FET peaks, optical smoothing (classic vocal chain)
- **Fast VCA → Slow VCA:** Peaks then body
- **API 2500 → SSL Bus:** Two VCAs, different characters
- **Plugin chains:** Multiple plugins, different characters

**Applications:**
- **Vocals:** Multiple gentle stages (more natural than single heavy)
- **Mix bus:** Gentle compression at multiple points
- **Mastering:** Typically 2-3 stages of gentle compression

**Professional Practice:** Each stage 3-4dB maximum. Total 6-12dB across chain. More transparent than 12dB from single compressor.

### Upward Compression
**Raising quieter parts instead of lowering louder parts (opposite of normal compression).**

**Concept:**
- Normal compression: lowers peaks above threshold
- Upward compression: raises quiet parts below threshold
- Reduces dynamic range from bottom up (not top down)
- Final result similar, but process opposite

**When to Use:**
- Detailed, quiet passages need boosting
- Want to preserve peak dynamics
- Bring up room sound, ambience
- Enhance sustain and decay tails

**Difference from Normal Compression:**
- Normal: Makes loud quieter (subtractive)
- Upward: Makes quiet louder (additive)
- Can be less audible (preserves peaks)

**Applications:**
- Enhancing quiet details
- Bringing up room ambience
- Less common (most compressors don't offer)
- More common in mastering

**Available In:**
- Some mastering processors
- Specialized plugins (DMG Limitless, Pro-C 2)
- Less common than downward
