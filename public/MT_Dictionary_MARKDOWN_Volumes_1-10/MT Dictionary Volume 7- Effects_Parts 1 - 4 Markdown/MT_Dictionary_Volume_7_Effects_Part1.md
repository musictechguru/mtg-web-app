# PART 1: REVERB

## 1. Reverb Fundamentals

### Reverb Definition
**Simulation of acoustic reflections in physical spaces creating sense of depth and environment.**

**What is Reverb:**
- Natural phenomenon: Sound reflects off surfaces
- Series of reflections: Early reflections + late reflections (reverb tail)
- Creates space: Sense of room, hall, chamber
- Adds depth: Distance perception, 3D quality
- Natural ambience: Makes recordings sound less dry

**Reverb Components:**
1. **Direct sound:** Original dry signal (no reflections)
2. **Early reflections:** First reflections (10-100ms), define room size/shape
3. **Late reflections (Reverb tail):** Dense reflections (100ms-10s+), create ambience
4. **Decay:** How reverb fades over time

**Why Use Reverb:**
- **Space:** Create sense of environment
- **Depth:** Front-to-back dimension in mix
- **Glue:** Blend elements together (common space)
- **Size:** Make things sound larger, more impressive
- **Natural:** Remove "dry" studio sound
- **Creative:** Special effects, otherworldly spaces

**Reverb Types Overview:**
- **Room:** Small spaces (10-20ms decay)
- **Hall:** Concert halls (1-3 seconds decay)
- **Chamber:** Echo chambers (0.5-1.5 seconds)
- **Plate:** Electromechanical (1-3 seconds, bright)
- **Spring:** Mechanical (guitar amps, vintage)
- **Convolution:** Real recorded spaces
- **Algorithmic:** Synthetic/mathematical

### Pre-Delay
**Time between dry signal and first reverb reflections.**

**Range:** 0-100ms typical (can be longer)

**Purpose:**
- Separates dry from wet
- Creates clarity (vocal intelligibility)
- Defines front-to-back distance
- Prevents smearing of transients

**Settings:**

**0ms (No Pre-delay):**
- Immediate reverb
- Intimate, close sound
- Can blur transients
- Less definition

**10-20ms:**
- Subtle separation
- Natural room sound
- Good starting point
- Most versatile

**30-50ms:**
- Clear separation (vocals stand out)
- Professional vocal reverb standard
- Prevents muddiness
- Maintains clarity

**60-100ms+:**
- Obvious separation (slapback effect)
- Special effect territory
- Very clear articulation
- Can sound unnatural

**Tempo-Synced Pre-delay:**
- Set to note value (1/16, 1/8, 1/4)
- Musical, rhythmic spacing
- Example: 120 BPM = 500ms per quarter note
- 1/16 note = 125ms pre-delay

**By Application:**
- **Vocals:** 20-40ms (clarity + space)
- **Drums:** 0-10ms (natural ambience)
- **Snare:** 20-30ms (definition + tail)
- **Mix bus:** 0-10ms (cohesion)

**Professional Practice:** Start with 20-30ms for vocals. Adjust by ear for clarity. Longer pre-delay = more separation, clearer articulation.

### Decay Time (RT60)
**Time for reverb to decrease by 60dB (essentially to silence).**

**RT60:** Reverberation Time (60dB decay) - acoustic measurement standard

**Decay Ranges:**

**Short (0.1-0.5 seconds):**
- Small rooms
- Tight, controlled
- Modern production
- Rock, pop, electronic
- Quick, punchy

**Medium (0.5-1.5 seconds):**
- Medium rooms, studios
- Natural, musical
- Most versatile
- General purpose
- Balanced space/clarity

**Long (1.5-3.0 seconds):**
- Concert halls, cathedrals
- Lush, smooth
- Ambient, atmospheric
- Ballads, orchestral
- Epic, large

**Very Long (3.0-10+ seconds):**
- Massive spaces, special effects
- Ambient music, sound design
- Ethereal, otherworldly
- Can overwhelm mix
- Use sparingly

**Decay by Genre:**
- **Rock/Pop:** 0.8-1.5s (controlled, clear)
- **R&B/Hip-Hop:** 0.5-1.2s (tight, modern)
- **Jazz:** 1.0-2.0s (natural, room-like)
- **Orchestral/Classical:** 2.0-4.0s (hall-like, lush)
- **Ambient/Soundscape:** 3.0-10s+ (atmospheric)

**Decay by Element:**
- **Vocals:** 1.2-2.0s (space without drowning)
- **Drums:** 0.4-1.0s (tight, controlled)
- **Snare:** 0.8-1.5s (body and tail)
- **Guitars:** 1.0-2.0s (depends on part)
- **Pads/Keys:** 2.0-4.0s (lush, ambient)

**Professional Practice:** Shorter decays for fast material (clarity). Longer for slow material (lushness). Adjust so reverb audible but not overwhelming.

### Early Reflections
**First reflections arriving 10-100ms after direct sound, defining room characteristics.**

**What They Are:**
- Discrete reflections before reverb tail
- Bounce off nearest surfaces (walls, ceiling, floor)
- Arrive separately (not yet dense)
- Define room size and shape

**Information Conveyed:**
- **Room size:** Time between reflections (longer = bigger)
- **Room shape:** Pattern of reflections
- **Material:** Frequency content of reflections
- **Distance:** Level relative to direct sound

**Parameters:**

**Level (Mix):**
- How loud early reflections vs direct and tail
- Higher: More defined space, clarity
- Lower: Smoother, less obvious space

**Timing:**
- When early reflections start (after direct)
- Spacing between reflections
- Shorter timing: Smaller room
- Longer timing: Larger room

**Character:**
- Frequency content (bright vs dark)
- Number of reflections (simple vs complex)
- Pattern (regular vs diffuse)

**Applications:**

**Enhance Presence:**
- Prominent early reflections
- Adds clarity and definition
- Vocal presence without wash

**Subtle Space:**
- Lower level early reflections
- Implies space without drawing attention
- Background elements, subtle depth

**Room Simulation:**
- Accurate early reflection pattern
- Realistic room emulation
- Convolution reverb strength

**Professional Practice:** Early reflections critical for realism and clarity. Often more important than tail for defining space. Adjust to add presence without muddiness.

### Diffusion
**Density and randomness of reverb reflections (echo density).**

**Low Diffusion:**
- Sparse reflections
- Discrete echoes audible
- Less smooth, more granular
- Can hear individual reflections
- Sounds: smaller, more intimate

**High Diffusion:**
- Dense, smooth reflections
- No individual echoes
- Smooth wash of reverb
- Dense cloud of reflections
- Sounds: larger, smoother, more natural

**Settings:**

**0-30% Diffusion:**
- Very sparse, echoey
- Individual reflections audible
- Small rooms, chambers
- Special effects
- Vintage character

**40-60% Diffusion:**
- Moderate density
- Some texture visible
- Natural room sound
- Balanced character
- Versatile

**70-100% Diffusion:**
- Very dense, smooth
- No individual reflections
- Hall-like, lush
- Modern, polished
- Professional standard

**By Application:**
- **Vocals:** 60-80% (smooth, lush)
- **Drums:** 40-60% (some texture, not too smooth)
- **Plates:** 70-90% (characteristic smooth sound)
- **Halls:** 80-100% (dense, luxurious)
- **Vintage effects:** 20-40% (discrete reflections)

**Professional Practice:** Higher diffusion for smoother, more transparent reverb. Lower for character and vintage vibe. Most modern production: 70-90%.

### Damping / HF Damping
**High-frequency absorption over time (simulating material absorption).**

**Real-World Physics:**
- High frequencies absorbed faster than lows
- Surfaces absorb highs (curtains, carpet, people)
- Natural reverb darkens over time
- Creates warm, natural decay

**Parameter:**
- Controls how quickly highs decay vs lows
- Higher damping: Faster high-frequency decay
- Lower damping: Highs sustain longer

**Settings:**

**Low Damping (Bright):**
- Highs sustain long time
- Bright, shimmery tail
- Hard surfaces (tile, glass, concrete)
- Can sound harsh, unnatural
- Electronic, special effects

**Medium Damping (Natural):**
- Moderate high-frequency decay
- Realistic room simulation
- Balanced, musical
- Most versatile
- Professional standard

**High Damping (Dark/Warm):**
- Highs decay quickly
- Warm, smooth tail
- Soft surfaces (curtains, carpet)
- Vintage, warm character
- Prevents harshness

**Frequency-Specific Damping:**
- Some reverbs: adjustable damping frequency
- Controls where absorption starts (2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz)
- More precise control
- Professional reverbs

**By Application:**
- **Vocals:** Medium-high damping (warm, smooth, prevents sibilance buildup)
- **Drums:** Medium damping (natural, controlled)
- **Acoustic instruments:** Low-medium damping (sparkle, natural)
- **Mix bus:** Medium-high damping (glue, not harsh)
- **Bright sources:** Higher damping (tame brightness)

**Professional Practice:** More damping = warmer, smoother. Less = brighter, can be harsh. Adjust to prevent reverb from being too bright/sibilant.

### Size (Room Size)
**Simulated dimensions of reverberant space.**

**Controls:**
- Overall room dimensions
- Early reflection timing
- Reverb density
- Frequency response (larger = more low end)

**Small (0-20%):**
- Tiny rooms, closets, booths
- 0.2-0.8 second decay typical
- Tight, intimate
- Close-miked character
- Modern, dry production

**Medium (20-50%):**
- Studios, living rooms, small clubs
- 0.8-1.5 second decay typical
- Natural, versatile
- Most common setting
- Balanced space

**Large (50-80%):**
- Concert halls, churches, large rooms
- 1.5-3.0 second decay typical
- Spacious, impressive
- Ballads, orchestral
- Epic, cinematic

**Huge (80-100%):**
- Cathedrals, arenas, canyons
- 3.0-10+ second decay typical
- Massive, overwhelming
- Ambient, special effects
- Use carefully

**Relationship to Decay:**
- Size affects decay time
- Larger size typically = longer decay
- But independent controls on most reverbs
- Can have large room with short decay (absorptive)

**Professional Practice:** Match size to song tempo and density. Fast songs: smaller sizes (clarity). Slow songs: larger sizes (lushness).

### Mix/Wet-Dry Balance
**Balance between dry (unprocessed) and wet (reverb) signals.**

**Dry (0% Wet):**
- No reverb audible
- Close, intimate, direct
- Maximum clarity
- No space

**10-20% Wet:**
- Subtle reverb
- Implied space
- Professional vocals
- Maintains clarity

**30-50% Wet:**
- Obvious reverb
- Noticeable space
- Pads, ambient elements
- Lush sound

**70-90% Wet:**
- Reverb dominant
- Special effects
- Sound design
- Ethereal, distant

**100% Wet:**
- Only reverb, no dry
- For send/return use
- Mix with dry at mixer
- Professional approach

**Insert vs Send/Return:**

**Insert (Wet/Dry Mix Used):**
- Reverb inserted on track
- Mix control blends dry/wet
- Simple, direct
- Less flexible

**Send/Return (100% Wet):**
- Reverb on aux track
- 100% wet on reverb
- Blend with send level
- Professional standard
- More flexible (EQ reverb separately, etc.)

**By Application:**
- **Vocals (lead):** 15-25% wet (presence + space)
- **Vocals (background):** 30-50% wet (depth, dimension)
- **Drums:** 10-20% wet (ambience, glue)
- **Snare:** 20-35% wet (body, sustain)
- **Pads:** 40-70% wet (lush, atmospheric)

**Professional Practice:** Send/return at 100% wet, control with send level. Less is more - start subtle, add as needed. Check in mix context, not solo.
