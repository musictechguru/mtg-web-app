### Convolution Reverb
**Digital reverb using recorded impulse responses (IRs) of real spaces.**

**How It Works:**
1. Record impulse response (IR): Play impulse (click/sweep) in space
2. Record room's response
3. Convolution algorithm: Applies IR to input signal
4. Result: Sounds like it's in that exact space

**Characteristics:**
- Extremely realistic (it's real space captured)
- Any space possible (cathedrals, studios, caves, forests)
- CPU-intensive
- Less adjustable (pre-baked character)
- Perfect realism

**IR Sources:**
- Famous studios (Abbey Road, Capitol, etc.)
- Concert halls worldwide
- Natural spaces (forests, canyons)
- Unusual spaces (parking garages, water tanks)
- Vintage hardware (captured EMT 140, Lexicon 224, etc.)

**Advantages:**
- Ultimate realism
- Access to any space (without being there)
- Capture vintage hardware impossible to own
- Free IRs available online

**Disadvantages:**

## 3. DELAY FUNDAMENTALS

### Delay Definition
**Repetition of audio signal after specified time interval.**

**Basic Concept:**
- Record audio
- Play it back after delay time
- Can repeat (feedback)
- Simple but powerful effect

**Components:**
1. **Delay time:** Time before repeat (ms or note values)
2. **Feedback:** How many repeats (0-100%+)
3. **Mix:** Balance dry/wet
4. **Filtering:** EQ on repeats (optional)

**Types:**
- **Slapback:** Single quick repeat (40-120ms)
- **Short delay:** 80-250ms, doubling effect
- **Medium delay:** 250-600ms, musical echoes
- **Long delay:** 600ms+, distinct echoes
- **Ping-pong:** Alternates left-right
- **Tape delay:** Analog tape simulation

---

### Delay Time
**Time interval between original and delayed signal.**

**Measurement:**
- **Milliseconds (ms):** Precise, not tempo-synced
- **Note values:** Musical, tempo-synced (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, dotted, triplet)

**Ranges:**

**Ultra-Short (1-10ms):**
- Comb filtering (phase effects)
- Not used for delay (phase issues)
- Avoided range

**Short/Slapback (20-120ms):**
- Single distinct echo
- Rockabilly, vintage vocals
- Doubling effect
- Famous: Elvis, Sun Records
- 50-100ms sweet spot

**Medium (120-400ms):**
- Distinct echo, still musical
- Rhythmic support
- Tempo-synced for groove
- Eighth notes typically
- Modern pop/rock standard

**Long (400-1000ms+):**
- Obvious echo
- Quarter notes or longer
- Spacious, atmospheric
- Ballads, ambient
- Dub, reggae

**Tempo-Synced Delay:**
- Lock to song tempo (BPM)
- Note values: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16
- Dotted notes: 1/4D, 1/8D (very musical)
- Triplets: 1/4T, 1/8T (shuffle feel)

**Delay Time Formula:**
- Delay (ms) = 60,000 / BPM / note division
- Example 120 BPM, quarter note: 60,000 / 120 / 1 = 500ms
- Example 120 BPM, eighth note: 60,000 / 120 / 2 = 250ms
- Dotted eighth: 375ms (1.5 × eighth note)

**Professional Practice:** Use tempo-synced delays for musical integration. Dotted eighth (1/8D) incredibly popular (U2, modern pop). Free ms for special effects.

### Feedback (Regeneration)
**Amount of delayed signal fed back into delay input for additional repeats.**

**Range:** 0-100% (and beyond)

**0% Feedback:**
- Single repeat only
- One echo
- Slapback delay
- Clean, simple

**20-40% Feedback:**
- 2-4 repeats
- Musical, controlled
- Most common setting
- Natural decay

**50-70% Feedback:**
- 5-10 repeats
- Obvious echo
- Spacious, atmospheric
- Ambient, dub

**80-95% Feedback:**
- Many repeats (10-20+)
- Long decay
- Can build up
- Ambient, experimental

**100% Feedback:**
- Infinite repeats (theoretical)
- Doesn't decay
- Actually self-oscillates (builds up)
- Special effect, careful

**Above 100%:**
- Self-oscillation
- Delay gets louder each repeat
- Runaway effect
- Creative chaos, noise
- Use carefully!

**By Application:**
- **Slapback (vocals):** 0-10% (single repeat)
- **Rhythmic delay:** 30-50% (musical echoes)
- **Ambient delay:** 60-80% (lush, spacious)
- **Dub delay:** 50-90% (characteristic long tails)

---

### Delay Mix (Wet/Dry)
**Balance between original and delayed signals.**

**Like reverb:** Can use insert or send/return

**Insert (Mix Control):**
- 0% wet: No delay
- 10-30% wet: Subtle, supportive
- 40-60% wet: Obvious, musical
- 80-100% wet: Effect dominant

**Send/Return (100% Wet):**
- Delay return at 100% wet
- Control with send level
- Professional standard
- More flexible

**By Application:**
- **Slapback:** 15-30% wet (subtle doubling)
- **Rhythmic delay:** 20-40% wet (support, not dominate)
- **Lead delay:** 30-50% wet (obvious but balanced)
- **Ambient/Dub:** 50-70% wet (effect prominent)

# PART 2: MODULATION EFFECTS

## 4. Modulation Fundamentals

### Modulation Definition
**Cyclic variation of audio parameters using LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator).**

**What Modulation Does:**
- Adds movement, animation
- Creates swirling, sweeping effects
- Thickens sound
- Adds width and dimension
- Prevents static, lifeless sound

**Common Modulation Effects:**

- **Flanger:** Short delay modulation, jet-plane
- **Phaser:** Phase shifting, sweeping
- **Tremolo:** Volume modulation, pulsing
- **Vibrato:** Pitch modulation, wobble

---

### Chorus
**Slight pitch modulation creating illusion of multiple voices/instruments.**

**How It Works:**
1. Duplicate signal
2. Delay slightly (10-30ms)
3. Modulate delay time with LFO
4. Creates pitch variation
5. Mix with dry signal

**Creates:**
- Thicker, wider sound
- Doubling effect (multiple performers)
- Stereo width
- Shimmer, movement

**Parameters:**

**Rate (Speed):**
- How fast LFO cycles
- Slow (0.1-1 Hz): Gentle movement
- Medium (1-3 Hz): Obvious chorus
- Fast (3-10 Hz): Vibrato-like

**Depth:**
- Amount of modulation
- Low: Subtle thickening
- High: Obvious pitch variation

**Mix:**
- Balance dry/wet
- 30-50% typical for chorus effect

**Applications:**
- **Electric guitars:** Classic 80s chorus (The Police, Nirvana)
- **Vocals:** Thickening, stereo width
- **Keys/pads:** Lush, wide, animated
- **Bass:** Width (carefully, can lose focus)

**Famous Chorus:**
