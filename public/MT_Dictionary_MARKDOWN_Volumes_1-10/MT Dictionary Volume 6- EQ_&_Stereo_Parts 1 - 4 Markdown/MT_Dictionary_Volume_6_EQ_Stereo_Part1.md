# PART 1: EQUALIZATION FUNDAMENTALS

## 1. EQ Theory & Core Concepts

### Equalization (EQ) Definition
**Selective boosting or cutting of specific frequencies to shape tonal balance.**

**Purpose:**
- **Corrective:** Fix problems (remove resonances, mud, harshness)
- **Creative:** Enhance character (add brightness, warmth, presence)
- **Separation:** Make elements distinct in mix (carve space)
- **Balance:** Create cohesive frequency spectrum across mix

**What EQ Does:**
- Boosts: Increases amplitude of specific frequencies
- Cuts: Decreases amplitude of specific frequencies
- Filters: Removes frequencies above or below certain point
- Shapes: Overall tonal balance and character

**Types of EQ:**
- **Parametric:** Full control (frequency, gain, Q)
- **Graphic:** Fixed frequencies, fader-based
- **Shelving:** Boosts/cuts all frequencies above/below point
- **Filters:** Removes frequencies (high-pass, low-pass)
- **Dynamic:** Frequency-dependent compression

**Frequency Ranges:**
- **Sub-bass:** 20-60Hz (rumble, weight, power)
- **Bass:** 60-250Hz (fundamental low end, warmth, body)
- **Low-mids:** 250-500Hz (body, warmth, can be muddy)
- **Mids:** 500Hz-2kHz (presence, body, clarity)
- **Upper-mids:** 2-4kHz (presence, attack, definition)
- **Presence:** 4-6kHz (clarity, articulation, intelligibility)
- **Brilliance:** 6-20kHz (air, sparkle, space, detail)

**EQ Workflow:**
- **Subtractive first:** Cut problems before boosting
- **Wide cuts, narrow boosts:** General mixing guideline
- **High-pass everything:** Except kick and bass
- **Context matters:** Solo vs mix context
- **Small moves:** 1-3dB changes significant

### Frequency (Hz/kHz)
**Pitch of sound measured in Hertz (cycles per second).**

**Hearing Range:** 20Hz to 20,000Hz (20kHz)
- Reduces with age and hearing damage
- Most critical range: 200Hz-5kHz (speech, fundamentals)

**Frequency Perception:**
- **Logarithmic:** Each octave doubles frequency
- **Musical intervals:** A4 = 440Hz, A5 = 880Hz (octave)
- **Equal spacing:** On EQ display represents octaves, not Hz

**Key Frequency Regions:**

**20-60Hz (Sub-Bass):**
- Characteristics: Felt more than heard, rumble, weight
- Sources: Kick drum fundamental, bass synth low end, 808 bass
- Too much: Muddy, boomy, wastes headroom
- Too little: Thin, lacks power and weight
- Mixing: High-pass most instruments here

**60-250Hz (Bass):**
- Characteristics: Warmth, body, fundamental bass
- Sources: Bass guitar, kick drum, low toms, male vocals
- Too much: Muddy, unclear, boomy mix
- Too little: Thin, weak, lacks warmth
- Critical: For fullness and power

**250-500Hz (Low-Mids):**
- Characteristics: Body, warmth, can accumulate (mud)
- Sources: Guitars, snare body, vocals, piano
- Too much: Muddy, boxy, undefined mix
- Too little: Hollow, thin, weak
- Most problematic: Frequency range (mud zone)

**500Hz-2kHz (Mids):**
- Characteristics: Presence, body, honky if too much
- Sources: Vocals, guitars, snare, most instruments
- Too much: Honky, nasal, harsh
- Too little: Distant, recessed, weak
- Where most fundamental: frequencies live

**2-4kHz (Upper-Mids):**
- Characteristics: Clarity, definition, presence, attack
- Sources: Vocal consonants, snare crack, guitar pick
- Too much: Harsh, fatiguing, aggressive
- Too little: Dull, distant, undefined
- Essential: For clarity and intelligibility

**4-6kHz (Presence):**
- Characteristics: Articulation, intelligibility, edge
- Sources: Vocal sibilance (s, t), cymbal attack, strings
- Too much: Harsh, sibilant, painful
- Too little: Dull, muffled, unclear
- Most sensitive: Human hearing (ear protection!)

**6-20kHz (Brilliance/Air):**
- Characteristics: Sparkle, air, space, detail, shimmer
- Sources: Cymbals, hi-hats, vocal breath, acoustic detail
- Too much: Harsh, brittle, sibilant
- Too little: Dull, dark, closed-in
- Adds: Openness and space to mix

### Gain/Amplitude (±dB)
**Amount of boost or cut applied at specific frequency.**

**Measurement:** Decibels (dB)
- Positive (+dB): Boost (increases level)
- Negative (-dB): Cut (decreases level)
- 0dB: No change (unity gain)

**Typical Boost/Cut Ranges:**
- **Subtle:** ±1-3dB (transparent, natural)
- **Moderate:** ±3-6dB (noticeable, musical)
- **Aggressive:** ±6-12dB (obvious, corrective)
- **Extreme:** ±12dB+ (special effects, problem-solving)

**Boosting:**
- Adds emphasis to frequencies
- Can introduce phase shift
- Reduces headroom (adds level)
- Use: Enhancement, presence, character
- Guideline: Boost 1-3dB typical, up to 6dB musical

**Cutting:**
- Removes problematic frequencies
- Less phase shift than boosting
- Increases headroom (reduces level)
- Use: Problem-solving, mud removal, harshness reduction
- Guideline: Cut 3-6dB typical, up to 12dB+ for problems

**Professional Philosophy:**
- **"Cut to fix, boost to enhance":** Cuts solve problems, boosts add character
- **"Make it worse, then better":** Boost to find problem, cut to fix
- **"Wide cuts, narrow boosts":** General guideline for musical EQ
- **"Less is more":** Small moves (1-3dB) often sufficient

**Perception:**
- 1dB: Barely noticeable, subtle
- 3dB: Clearly noticeable
- 6dB: Very noticeable, significant change
- 10dB+: Extreme, obvious change

### Q (Bandwidth/Width)
**Width of frequency band affected by EQ adjustment (Quality factor).**

**Definition:**
- Q = Quality factor
- Determines: How narrow or wide the EQ band
- Higher Q: Narrower band (surgical, precise)
- Lower Q: Wider band (musical, natural)

**Q Values:**
- **0.5-0.7:** Very wide (multiple octaves, musical, gentle)
- **1.0-1.5:** Moderate width (1-2 octaves, standard)
- **2.0-5.0:** Narrow (1/2-1 octave, corrective)
- **10+:** Very narrow (surgical, notch filter, feedback elimination)

**Bandwidth:**
- Alternative to Q (inverse relationship)
- Measured in octaves
- Width of affected frequency range
- Wider bandwidth = lower Q, narrower bandwidth = higher Q

**Relationship:**
- Q = 1.41 / Bandwidth (octaves)
- Example: 1 octave bandwidth = Q of 1.41
- Example: 2 octave bandwidth = Q of 0.7

**When to Use Wide Q (Low Q):**
- Musical EQ (gentle tonal shaping)
- Broad frequency adjustments
- Natural-sounding changes
- Mix bus EQ
- Mastering
- Example: Boosting 10kHz with Q 0.7 for "air" (affects 5kHz-20kHz)

**When to Use Narrow Q (High Q):**
- Surgical cuts (remove specific resonances)
- Notch filters (eliminate feedback, hum)
- Find and remove problems
- Precise corrections
- Example: Cutting 3.2kHz with Q 5.0 to remove cabinet resonance

**Bell Curve:**
- Shape of parametric EQ boost/cut
- Peak at center frequency
- Tapers off on sides
- Width determined by Q
- Symmetric around center frequency

**Visual:**
- Wide Q (0.5): Gentle hill/valley (affects many frequencies)
- Medium Q (1.5): Moderate hill/valley (standard)
- Narrow Q (5.0): Sharp spike/notch (surgical, specific)

**Professional Practice:**
- Start wide, narrow as needed
- Use narrow Q to find problems (sweep with boost)
- Use wide Q to fix problems (cut with wide Q)
- Narrow boosts: Can sound unnatural
- Wide cuts: More musical, transparent

---

### Center Frequency
**Exact frequency where EQ boost or cut is centered.**

**Selection:**
- Choose: Based on problem or enhancement goal
- Sweep: To find resonances or sweetspots
- Precise: In parametric EQ (20Hz-20kHz range)
- Fixed: In graphic EQ (predetermined frequencies)

**Finding Problem Frequencies:**
1. Set large boost (+10dB)
2. Set narrow Q (3-5)
3. Sweep frequency range
4. Listen for harshness, resonance, or problems
5. When found, switch to cut with wider Q

**Common Problem Frequencies:**
- **80-120Hz:** Boominess in bass/kick
- **200-400Hz:** Muddiness, boxiness
- **500Hz-1kHz:** Honky, nasal quality
- **2-4kHz:** Harshness (electric guitars, vocals)
- **6-8kHz:** Sibilance (vocals)

**Enhancement Frequencies:**
- **60-80Hz:** Sub-bass weight
- **100-200Hz:** Warmth, body
- **3-5kHz:** Presence, clarity
- **8-12kHz:** Air, brilliance
- **10-15kHz:** Sparkle, sheen

---

### Phase Shift (EQ)
**Change in timing relationship between frequencies caused by EQ.**

**What Happens:**
- All EQ creates phase shift
- Different frequencies delayed by different amounts
- Boosting: More phase shift than cutting
- Minimum-phase EQ: Standard behavior
- Linear-phase EQ: No phase shift (but pre-ringing)

**Minimum-Phase EQ (Standard):**
- Natural EQ behavior
- Phase shift increases with boost/cut amount
- Phase shift increases with Q
- Can affect stereo image slightly
- Can cause cancellation when summed to mono
- More "analog" sounding
- No pre-ringing

**Linear-Phase EQ:**
- Digital-only (impossible in analog)
- No phase shift (maintains phase relationships)
- Perfect mono compatibility
- Better for mastering (stereo image preserved)
- Causes pre-ringing (energy before transient)
- More CPU intensive
- Can sound less natural on drums

**When Phase Matters:**
- Multi-mic recordings (drums)
- Stereo recordings
- Mastering (maintain stereo image)
- Mono compatibility

**When Phase Doesn't Matter:**
- Single-mic recordings
- Mono sources
- Creative EQ (character)

**Professional Practice:**
- Use minimum-phase for most mixing
- Use linear-phase for mastering or stereo material
- Trust your ears (phase shift often not audible issue)
