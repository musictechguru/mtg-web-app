# PART 2: CABLES & CONNECTORS

## 4. Cable Types & Connectors

### XLR Cable (Balanced)
**3-pin professional audio cable for balanced signals - microphones, professional gear.**

**Pin Configuration:**
- Pin 1: Ground/Shield
- Pin 2: Hot/Positive (+)
- Pin 3: Cold/Negative (-)
- Balanced signal (noise cancellation)

**Advantages:**
- **Balanced:** Rejects noise and interference
- **Long runs:** Can run 100+ feet without noise
- **Locking connector:** Stays connected securely
- **Professional standard:** All pro audio uses XLR
- **Phantom power:** Can carry +48V for condensers

**Common Uses:**
- Microphones (all professional mics)
- Monitor outputs (studio monitors)
- Preamp inputs/outputs
- Snake cables (multi-channel)
- Stage/live sound

**Balanced Signal:**
- Same signal sent on pins 2 and 3 (opposite polarity)
- Interference affects both equally
- Receiving device: Subtracts pin 3 from pin 2
- Interference cancels, signal doubles
- Very effective noise rejection

**Cable Quality:**
- Budget: $10-20 (adequate for home studio)
- Mid: $20-40 (better shielding)
- Premium: $40-100+ (Mogami, Canare, Neutrik connectors)
- Diminishing returns (budget cables fine for most)

**Length Considerations:**
- <25 feet: Any quality works
- 25-50 feet: Good cable recommended
- 50-100 feet: Quality important
- 100+ feet: Premium cable (Mogami, Canare)

**Professional Practice:** XLR for all microphones. Balanced signal mandatory for professional work. Budget cables fine for home studio. Quality matters more for long runs.

### TRS Cable (Balanced 1/4")
**Tip-Ring-Sleeve 1/4" cable carrying balanced signals.**

**Pin Configuration:**
- Tip: Hot/Positive (+)
- Ring: Cold/Negative (-)
- Sleeve: Ground/Shield
- Balanced (like XLR)

**Uses:**
- Monitor outputs (speakers)
- Insert sends/returns
- Headphones (stereo on single connector)
- Balanced line-level connections
- Patch bays

**TRS vs TS:**
- **TRS:** Balanced (tip-ring-sleeve, 3 conductors)
- **TS:** Unbalanced (tip-sleeve, 2 conductors)
- Look identical externally (check connector)
- TRS has two black rings, TS has one

**Stereo Use:**
- Headphones: Tip = Left, Ring = Right, Sleeve = Ground
- Different from balanced (not left/right, but +/-)
- Same connector, different application

**Professional Practice:** TRS for balanced connections. Monitor outputs should be TRS (balanced). Don't confuse with TS (unbalanced).

---

### TS Cable (Unbalanced 1/4")
**Tip-Sleeve 1/4" unbalanced cable - instruments, line-level.**

**Pin Configuration:**
- Tip: Signal
- Sleeve: Ground
- Unbalanced (no noise rejection)

**Uses:**
- Guitar cables (instrument level)
- Keyboard outputs (often)
- Patch cables (pedals, synths)
- Insert returns
- Anywhere unbalanced acceptable

**Limitations:**
- **Unbalanced:** Susceptible to noise
- **Short runs only:** <20 feet ideal
- **High-impedance:** Instrument level
- Not for long runs or professional work

**When Acceptable:**
- Short runs (<20 feet)
- Low-noise environment
- Instrument level (guitars, keys)
- Patch cables between pedals

**Professional Practice:** Use for guitar cables only. Keep short (<20 feet). Replace with TRS/XLR for long runs or critical signals.

### RCA Cable (Phono/Cinch)
**Consumer audio connector - home stereo, DJ equipment.**

**Characteristics:**
- Red connector: Right channel
- White (or black): Left channel
- Unbalanced connection
- Consumer standard
- Not professional audio

**Uses:**
- DJ equipment (turntables, CDJs)
- Consumer audio (home stereo)
- Legacy equipment
- Some audio interfaces (consumer models)

**Professional Use:**
- Rare in professional studios
- DJ setups (turntables)
- Consumer playback devices
- Generally avoid if possible

### Optical (TOSLINK/ADAT)
**Digital optical cable using light pulses to transmit digital audio.**

**Types:**

**TOSLINK (S/PDIF Optical):**
- Consumer digital audio
- 2 channels (stereo)
- Sample rates up to 192kHz
- Home theater, consumer gear

**ADAT Lightpipe:**
- Professional standard
- 8 channels at 44.1/48kHz
- 4 channels at 88.2/96kHz
- Interface expansion

**Advantages:**
- Immune to electrical interference (optical)
- Galvanic isolation (no ground loops)
- Multiple channels (ADAT)
- Digital (no conversion)

**Limitations:**
- Fragile (fiber optic cable)
- Limited length (<10 meters typical)
- More expensive than copper
- Connector fragile

**Professional Use:** ADAT for interface expansion. Connect 8-channel preamps to interface. Common in professional setups.

---

### USB & Thunderbolt
**Digital connection standards for audio interfaces and computers.**

**USB:**
- **USB 2.0:** Up to 480 Mbps, adequate for 16-24 channels
- **USB 3.0/3.1:** Up to 5-10 Gbps, high channel counts
- **USB-C:** Modern connector, backwards compatible
- Universal compatibility (Mac, PC, Linux)
- Most common interface connection

**Thunderbolt:**
- **Thunderbolt 2:** 20 Gbps, Mini DisplayPort connector
- **Thunderbolt 3/4:** 40 Gbps, USB-C connector
- Very low latency (better than USB)
- High channel counts (64+ channels possible)
- Mac standard, some PC
- More expensive (interfaces and cables)
- Professional choice for lowest latency

**Latency Comparison:**
- Thunderbolt: ~2ms round-trip (excellent)
- USB 3.0: ~3-5ms round-trip (very good)
- USB 2.0: ~5-10ms round-trip (acceptable)
- All adequate for recording (human perception ~10ms)

**Professional Practice:** USB adequate for most. Thunderbolt for lowest latency or high channel counts. USB-C modern standard (check compatibility).
