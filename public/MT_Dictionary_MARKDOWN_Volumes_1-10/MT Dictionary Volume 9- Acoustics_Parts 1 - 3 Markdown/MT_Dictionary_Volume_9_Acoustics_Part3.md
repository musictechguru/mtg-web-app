# PART 3: MONITORING & CALIBRATION

## 5. Headphone Monitoring

### Studio Headphones
**Headphones designed for accurate monitoring - different from consumer headphones.**

**Studio vs Consumer:**
- **Studio:** Flat frequency response, accuracy
- **Consumer:** Enhanced bass/treble, "exciting" sound
- **Studio:** Truth (reveal problems)
- **Consumer:** Flattery (sound pleasing)

**Headphone Types:**

**Closed-Back:**
- Sealed cups (isolate from outside)
- No sound leakage (recording while monitoring)
- Tighter bass (sealed design)
- More isolation
- Use: Tracking, recording, on-the-go

**Open-Back:**
- Vented cups (air flow)
- Sound leakage (can't use while recording)
- More natural, spacious sound
- Better stereo imaging
- Use: Mixing, critical listening, mastering

**Semi-Open:**
- Partially vented
- Compromise between closed and open
- Some isolation, some openness
- Balanced approach

**Driver Types:**
- **Dynamic:** Most common, good bass
- **Planar Magnetic:** Fast, accurate, expensive
- **Electrostatic:** Ultimate accuracy, very expensive

**Impedance:**
- **Low (32-80 ohms):** Easy to drive, phones/portable
- **High (250-600 ohms):** Need headphone amp, better quality
- Match impedance to source

**Famous Studio Headphones:**

**Budget Closed-Back ($50-150):**
- **Sony MDR-7506:** Industry standard, $100, found everywhere
- **Audio-Technica ATH-M50x:** Popular, accurate, $150
- **AKG K240 Studio:** Semi-open, balanced, $70
- **Sennheiser HD 280 Pro:** Good isolation, $100

**Mid-Range ($150-400):**
- **Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro:** Closed, comfortable, various impedances, $150-200
- **Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro:** Open, detailed, $150-200
- **Sennheiser HD 650:** Open, smooth, legendary, $350-400
- **Audio-Technica ATH-R70x:** Open, reference, $350

**Professional ($400-1000+):**
- **Sennheiser HD 800S:** Open, spacious, analytical, $1,700
- **Focal Clear:** Open, accurate, revealing, $1,500
- **Audeze LCD-X:** Planar, flat, professional, $1,200
- **Neumann NDH 20:** Closed, neutral, German, $500

**Mixing on Headphones:**
- Possible but challenging
- Lacks crossfeed (speakers blend left/right)
- Stereo image different (super-wide)
- Bass response different (no room interaction)
- Use: Checking details, supplementing speakers

**Headphone Mixing Challenges:**
- **No crossfeed:** Left ear only hears left speaker (unnatural)
- **Over-wide panning:** Sounds wrong on speakers
- **Bass judgment:** Hard to judge bass properly
- **Fatigue:** Ear fatigue faster than speakers
- **No room:** Can't judge room interaction

**Solutions:**
- Use headphones + speakers (cross-reference)
- Headphone calibration software (Sonarworks, Waves Nx)
- Take breaks (ear fatigue)
- Know your headphones (learn their sound)
- Check mix on speakers always

**Professional Practice:** Headphones supplemental to speakers. Great for detail work, editing, checking stereo field. Not ideal for final mix decisions. Sony MDR-7506 industry standard reference. Use open-back for mixing if possible.

### Headphone Correction/Calibration
**Software compensation for headphone frequency response to improve accuracy.**

**Why Needed:**
- All headphones have frequency response curves
- None perfectly flat
- Different models have different colorations
- Correction compensates for deviations

**Correction Software:**

**Sonarworks Reference 4 Headphone Edition ($99):**
- Individual headphone profiles
- Thousands of models measured
- Systemwide or plugin
- Flat target curve
- Industry standard

**Waves Nx ($99-199):**
- Headphone correction + spatial simulation
- Virtual room simulation
- Head tracking (with camera)
- Speaker emulation

**Morphit by Toneboosters ($99):**
- Headphone correction
- Emulate other headphones
- Customizable target curves

**How It Works:**
1. Load profile for your headphone model
2. Software applies inverse EQ
3. Compensates for frequency response
4. Results in flatter response

**Benefits:**
- More accurate frequency balance
- Better mix translation
- Confidence in headphone mixes
- Consistency across headphones

**Limitations:**
- Can't fix everything (spatial issues remain)
- Approximation (individual variance in headphones)
- Still need speakers for final check
- Calibration not perfect

**Professional Practice:** Use correction software if mixing on headphones significantly. Sonarworks most popular. Still check on speakers. Correction helps but not miracle solution.

## 6. Calibration & Measurement

### Room Correction Software
**DSP correction to compensate for room acoustic problems.**

**Concept:**
- Measure room frequency response
- Create inverse EQ curve
- Apply correction to compensate
- Flatter response at listening position

**Types:**

**Standalone Hardware:**
- Trinnov Audio (high-end, $10k+)
- DBX DriveRack (PA systems, $500-1000)
- Built into monitor (Genelec SAM, Neumann MA-1)

**Software:**
- Sonarworks Reference 4 ($349 with mic)
- IK Multimedia ARC System ($200-300 with mic)
- Dirac Live ($500-1000 various versions)

**Process:**
1. Measure room at listening position (multiple points)
2. Software analyzes frequency response
3. Generates correction curve
4. Applies EQ compensation
5. Flatter response at sweet spot

**What It Can Fix:**
- Frequency response dips/peaks (somewhat)
- Speaker/room interaction
- Small modal issues (limited)
- High-frequency response

**What It Can't Fix:**
- Room modes completely (physical problem)
- Time-domain issues (reflections, decay)
- Poor speaker placement
- Bad acoustic treatment
- Can't replace proper treatment

**Limitations:**
- Only corrects listening position (narrow sweet spot)
- Can't create bass that doesn't exist
- Time-domain problems remain
- Not substitute for treatment
- Can reduce headroom (boosting EQ)

**Professional Opinion Divided:**
- Some engineers: Very helpful, use it
- Others: Don't trust, acoustic treatment only
- Reality: Helps but supplement to treatment, not replacement

**Best Practice:**
1. Treat room acoustically first (bass traps, panels)
2. Position speakers optimally
3. Then consider room correction (final polish)
4. Don't rely on correction alone

**Professional Practice:** Acoustic treatment first priority. Room correction as final touch. Don't use as substitute for treatment. Helps but not magic. Genelec/Neumann auto-calibration excellent (if budget allows).

### SPL Meter & Calibration Level
**Measuring and setting consistent monitoring levels for accurate mixing.**

**Why Calibrate:**
- Consistent level between sessions
- Fletcher-Munson compensation (hearing perception)
- Prevent ear fatigue
- Professional standard
- Mix translates better

**Target SPL Levels:**

**Reference Level (Pink Noise):**
- -20dBFS pink noise → 85dB SPL at listening position
- Film industry standard (THX)
- Music: Often 78-83dB SPL (quieter, less fatiguing)

**Typical Mixing Levels:**
- **Loud:** 85dB SPL (reference, short periods)
- **Medium:** 78-83dB SPL (most mixing, comfortable)
- **Quiet:** 70-75dB SPL (checking, late night, avoiding fatigue)
- Vary levels during session (hear different perspectives)

**Fletcher-Munson Curves:**
- Hearing perception changes with level
- Louder: More bass and treble perceived
- Quieter: Less bass and treble perceived
- 85dB SPL: Flattest perception
- Mix at multiple levels to compensate

**Calibration Process:**
1. Get SPL meter (app or hardware, $30-100)
2. Play -20dBFS pink noise from DAW
3. Measure at listening position
4. Adjust monitor volume to 78-85dB SPL
5. Set monitor volume, don't change (use DAW fader for level)

**SPL Meter Options:**
- **Smartphone app:** Free-$10 (adequate for rough calibration)
- **Decibel X (iOS):** Free, good
- **Hardware meter:** $30-200 (more accurate)
- **Radio Shack SPL meter:** $50 (classic, adequate)
- **Professional meter:** $200+ (very accurate)

**C-Weighting vs A-Weighting:**
- **C-weighting:** Flatter, includes bass, preferred for music
- **A-weighting:** Compensates for hearing, film standard
- Use C-weighting for music typically

**Monitoring at Different Levels:**
- Start medium (78-83dB)
- Check loud (85dB) for detail (short periods)
- Check quiet (70-75dB) for balance
- Low level: Bass seems weak (Fletcher-Munson)
- High level: Bass seems strong
- Mix sounds good at all levels = good mix

**Professional Practice:** Calibrate to 78-83dB SPL (pink noise method). Mix at moderate level mostly. Check at loud/quiet levels periodically. Protect hearing (85dB+ dangerous for extended periods).

### Room Measurement (REW)
**Room EQ Wizard - free software for comprehensive acoustic measurement.**

**What is REW:**
- Free room measurement software (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Measures frequency response, impulse response, RT60
- Industry standard for DIY/project studios
- Professional-grade results

**What You Need:**
- Computer with REW installed (free)
- Measurement microphone (calibrated, $100-200)
- Audio interface (for mic input)
- That's it!

**Measurement Mic:**
- **MiniDSP UMIK-1:** USB mic, calibrated, $100 (most popular)
- **Dayton Audio UMM-6:** USB, cheaper, $30
- **Behringer ECM8000:** XLR, needs interface, $40
- Calibration file essential (compensates for mic)

**What REW Measures:**

**Frequency Response:**
- How room + speakers respond at each frequency
- Shows peaks and dips
- Identify room modes
- Guide treatment placement

**Waterfall Plot:**
- Frequency response over time
- Shows decay at each frequency
- Reveals room modes (slow decay)
- Beautiful visualization

**RT60:**
- Reverberation time
- Overall and frequency-dependent
- Target: 0.3-0.4s for control room

**Impulse Response:**
- Time-domain measurement
- Shows reflections
- Analyze early vs late reflections

**How to Use REW:**
1. Set up measurement mic at listening position
2. Play sweep tone from speakers
3. REW records and analyzes
4. View frequency response, waterfall, RT60
5. Identify problems (room modes, reflections)
6. Add treatment, re-measure
7. Repeat until improved

**What to Look For:**
- Large peaks/dips (>10dB): Room modes, problems
- Decay time: Should be even across frequency
- First reflections: In impulse response
- Resonances: In waterfall plot

**Professional Practice:** REW essential for room treatment. Measure before treatment (baseline). Measure after each treatment addition. Guide treatment placement and quantity. Free but professional quality.

## 7. Monitoring Techniques

### Mix Referencing
**Comparing your mix to professional masters for perspective and quality check.**

**Why Reference:**
- Tonal balance comparison (frequency response)
- Loudness check (LUFS target)
- Stereo width reference
- Quality benchmark
- Genre standards

**Choosing References:**
- Same genre (match expectations)
- Recent releases (current production standards)
- Professional quality (well-mastered)
- Multiple tracks (3-5 minimum, not just one)
- Songs you know well

**Level Matching:**
- **Critical:** Match perceived loudness
- References typically louder (mastered)
- Turn down reference to match your mix level
- LUFS meter helpful (±1 LU)
- Prevents "louder = better" illusion

**What to Compare:**
- **Low end:** How much bass? How tight?
- **Midrange:** Clarity, body, presence
- **High end:** Brightness, air, sparkle
- **Stereo width:** How wide? Center focus?
- **Loudness:** How loud? Dynamic range?
- **Overall balance:** Tonal balance, cohesion

**How to Reference:**
1. Import reference tracks to DAW
2. Match levels (very important!)
3. A/B quickly (instant switching)
4. Note differences
5. Adjust your mix toward reference

**Quick Switching:**
- Keyboard shortcut for instant A/B
- Long gaps between = memory fades
- Quick switching = accurate comparison
- 5-10 seconds between switches ideal

**Don't Copy Blindly:**
- Reference shows possibilities, not rules
- Your mix may need different approach
- Use multiple references (not just one)
- Develop your own sound

**Tools:**
- REFERENCE plugin by Mastering the Mix ($99)
- Magic AB by Sample Magic ($99)
- Built-in DAW functionality (simple tracks)

**Professional Practice:** Always use references. Multiple tracks (3-5). Level match precisely. Quick A/B switching. Compare tonal balance and width. Aim for similar quality, not identical sound.

### Monitor Switching
**Using multiple monitoring systems to check mix translation.**

**Why Multiple Systems:**
- Different speakers reveal different problems
- Check mix translates to all systems
- No one speaker perfect
- Real-world listening check

**Typical Monitoring Chain:**

**Primary (Near-Field):**
- Main mixing speakers
- Most time spent here
- Accurate, revealing
- Examples: Yamaha HS7, Adam A7X

**Secondary (Alternate):**
- Different perspective
- Check translation
- Often smaller/different character
- Examples: Auratone 5C, Avantone MixCube

**Tertiary (Real-World):**
- Consumer systems
- Car stereo, earbuds, laptop, phone
- How most people listen
- Reality check

**Auratone 5C / Avantone MixCube:**
- Single small driver
- Limited frequency response
- Focuses attention on midrange
- Classic mixing tool ($200-300 single)
- If sounds good here, translates well

**Why Small Speaker:**
- Reveals midrange balance
- No bass distraction (mix on bass alone)
- Simulates small speakers (phones, laptops)
- Clarity check

**Switching Strategy:**
1. Mix on primary speakers (main work)
2. Check on secondary (alternative perspective)
3. Check on consumer systems (reality check)
4. Adjust if needed
5. Repeat

**What Each System Reveals:**
- **Primary:** Overall balance, detail
- **Small speaker:** Midrange, vocal clarity
- **Car stereo:** Real-world, bass-heavy
- **Earbuds:** Bright, consumer sound
- **Phone/laptop:** Worst case

**Professional Practice:** Primary speakers for main work. Small speaker for midrange check. Real-world systems for translation. If sounds good everywhere, it's a good mix.

### Taking Breaks
**Rest periods during mixing crucial for accuracy and perspective.**

**Why Breaks Essential:**

**Ear Fatigue:**
- Hearing degrades with continuous loud exposure
- Frequency sensitivity decreases
- High frequencies especially (temporary threshold shift)
- 85dB+ causes rapid fatigue

**Brain Fatigue:**
- Decision-making ability decreases
- Diminishing returns on work
- Lose objectivity
- Can't hear problems

**Perspective Loss:**
- Get used to mix (sounds "normal")
- Can't hear objectively anymore
- Fresh ears reveal problems
- Breaks reset perspective

**Break Schedule:**

**Micro Breaks (Every 45-60 minutes):**
- 5-10 minutes away from speakers
- Leave room (important - different acoustic)
- Rest ears
- Prevents fatigue buildup

**Meal Breaks (Every 3-4 hours):**
- 30-60 minutes away
- Eat, walk, different activity
- Mental reset
- Return refreshed

**Sleep (Overnight):**
- Most important break
- Sleep resets hearing and judgment
- Morning: Fresh ears (hear everything clearly)
- Often reveals obvious problems

**Loudness Management:**
- Mix at moderate levels (78-83dB SPL)
- Reduce fatigue
- Hear more accurately
- Protect hearing

**The Morning Test:**
- Listen to yesterday's work in morning
- Fresh ears reveal problems immediately
- Problems obvious that weren't before
- Make corrections

**Professional Practice:** Break every 45-60 minutes (minimum). Sleep on mix (check next day). Mix at moderate levels. Fresh ears most accurate ears. Forcing through fatigue = bad decisions.

### Mono Checking
**Checking mix in mono to identify phase issues and ensure compatibility.**

**Why Check Mono:**
- Mono compatibility (phones, Bluetooth, some PA systems)
- Reveal phase cancellation
- Check mix core (without width tricks)
- Balance fundamentals
- Essential quality control

**How to Check:**
- Mono switch on interface/controller
- Utility plugin (mono mode)
- Sum to mono in DAW
- Temporary (switch back to stereo)

**What to Listen For:**

**Elements Disappear:**
- Phase cancellation
- Stereo processing artifacts
- Width plugins causing problems
- Need to fix (adjust processing)

**Level Changes:**
- Some elements quieter in mono (normal)
- Some louder (also normal)
- But shouldn't disappear
- Center elements should stay same

**Tonality Changes:**
- Thin sound: Too much stereo widening
- Phasey artifacts: Processing issues
- Should sound similar to stereo (just narrower)

**What Should Happen in Mono:**
- Mix should sound coherent (not broken)
- Nothing should disappear completely
- Balance should remain (relative levels)
- Tone should be similar (not drastically different)

**Common Problems Revealed:**
- Stereo widening too extreme
- Phase-cancelled instruments
- M/S processing issues
- Delay-based stereo (Haas) problems

**Professional Practice:** Check mono regularly during mix. Essential quality control. Important elements must survive mono (vocals, bass, drums). Fix phase problems before stereo enhancement.

### Critical Listening
**Focused, analytical listening to identify and solve problems.**

**What is Critical Listening:**
- Active, focused attention
- Analytical (not enjoyment)
- Problem identification
- Objectivity
- Trained skill (develops over time)

**How to Listen Critically:**

**Focus on Specific Elements:**
- One instrument at a time
- Listen through clutter
- Isolate in mind
- Check level, tone, placement

**Frequency Ranges:**
- Low end (balance, clarity, mud)
- Midrange (body, honk, clarity)
- High end (brightness, harshness, air)
- Each separately

**Stereo Field:**
- Panning (width, placement)
- Depth (front-to-back)
- Phase (mono check)
- Balance (left-right)

**Dynamics:**
- Loud vs quiet sections
- Compression (too much/little)
- Transients (preserved/squashed)
- Consistency

**Technical Issues:**
- Clicks, pops, distortion
- Noise, hum, buzz
- Phase problems
- Artifacts (processing, editing)

**Listening Modes:**

**Analytical (Critical):**
- Dissect mix
- Find problems
- Technical focus
- Not enjoyable (work)

**Musical (Feel):**
- Experience emotion
- Groove and vibe
- Overall impression
- Enjoyment

**Balance Both:**
- Analytical: Find and fix problems
- Musical: Check vibe and emotion
- Switch between modes
- Both essential

**Developing Critical Listening:**
- Practice regularly
- Compare to references
- ABX training (compare blindly)
- Learn instrument sounds
- Study great mixes
- Years of experience

**Professional Practice:** Develop critical listening through practice. Switch between analytical and musical listening. Use references constantly. Train ears through active listening. Check everything (levels, tone, stereo, dynamics, technical).
