# PART 2: ACOUSTIC TREATMENT

## 3. Treatment Types & Placement

### Bass Traps
**Specialized absorption for low frequencies (20-300Hz) - most critical treatment.**

**Why Bass Traps Critical:**
- Low frequencies hardest to control
- Room modes cause biggest problems
- Standard absorption doesn't work (wavelengths too long)
- Corners accumulate most bass energy
- First priority in any room treatment

**Corner Placement:**
- **Tri-corners (ceiling-wall junction):** Maximum effectiveness
- **Wall-wall corners:** Very effective
- **Floor-wall corners:** Also effective
- Sound pressure maximum in corners (all modes)

**Bass Trap Types:**

**Porous Absorption (Thick):**
- Dense fiberglass/rockwool
- 6-12 inches thick minimum
- Corner-mounted (straddling corner)
- Broadband absorption
- Most common and effective

**Membrane/Panel Absorbers:**
- Tuned to specific frequency
- Panel vibrates, absorbs energy
- Good for targeting specific modes
- More complex to build/tune

**Resonant Absorbers (Helmholtz):**
- Tuned cavity absorber
- Narrow-band absorption
- Targets specific frequency
- Requires calculation/tuning

**Commercial Bass Traps:**
- GIK Acoustics (Tri-Traps, Monster, Soffit)
- RealTraps (MondoTraps)
- Auralex (LENRD bass traps)
- Prices: $100-300 each, need 4-8+ typically

**DIY Bass Traps:**
- Rockwool/OC 703 in corner frames
- 24"×24"×48" typical size
- Corner-mounted (air gap behind)
- Material cost: $30-60 per trap
- 6-8 traps typical small room

**Coverage:**
- All four ceiling corners (priority #1)
- All four floor corners (if space allows)
- Wall-wall corners (secondary)
- More is better (diminishing returns after saturation)

**Effectiveness:**
- Thicker = better low-frequency absorption
- Corner placement = maximum efficiency
- Multiple traps = smoother response
- Can't over-treat bass typically

**Professional Practice:** Bass traps first priority. Minimum 4 (tri-corners), ideal 8+ (all corners). Thick dense material (6-12"). Test with measurements (before/after).

### Acoustic Panels (Broadband Absorption)
**Mid-high frequency absorption panels for controlling reflections.**

**Purpose:**
- Reduce flutter echoes
- Control first reflections
- Tame room reverb
- Prevent comb filtering

**Panel Construction:**
- Core: Fiberglass/rockwool (2-4 inches thick)
- Density: 3-6 lbs/ft³ (OC 703, Roxul Safe'n'Sound)
- Frame: Wood (1×4 or 2×4)
- Fabric: Acoustically transparent (burlap, linen, muslin)
- Size: 24"×48" or 24"×24" common

**Thickness vs Frequency:**
- 1 inch: >2kHz effective
- 2 inches: >500Hz effective
- 4 inches: >250Hz effective
- 6+ inches: Approaches bass trap (>125Hz)

**Placement (Critical Positions):**

**First Reflection Points:**
- Mirror test: Where you see speakers from listening position
- Side walls (between speakers and listener)
- Ceiling (above listening position)
- Priority #1 after bass traps

**Rear Wall:**
- Behind listening position
- Prevents slap-back
- Diffusion alternative

**Between Speakers:**
- Reduces early reflections
- Improves stereo image
- Small panel sufficient

**Coverage Guidelines:**
- 20-40% wall coverage typical
- More coverage = dryer sound
- Less coverage = livelier sound
- Balance is key

**Commercial Panels:**
- GIK Acoustics 242/244 ($60-120 each)
- Auralex ProPanels ($40-80 each)
- Primacoustic Broadway ($50-100 each)

**DIY Panels:**
- Material cost: $20-40 per 24"×48" panel
- Need 6-12 panels typical room
- Total: $150-500 DIY vs $500-1500 commercial

**Professional Practice:** First reflections most critical. Use mirror test for placement. 2-4 inch thickness standard. Don't over-treat (leave some life in room).

### Diffusers
**Scatter reflections rather than absorb - maintains room liveliness.**

**When to Use:**
- After absorption needs met
- Want to maintain energy/liveliness
- Rear wall (behind listening position)
- Live end of live-end/dead-end design

**Diffuser Types:**

**QRD (Quadratic Residue Diffuser):**
- Mathematical well depths (prime number sequences)
- Broadband scattering
- Most effective
- 2D or 1D versions

**Skyline Diffuser:**
- Varied height blocks
- 2D scattering pattern
- Aesthetic appeal
- Similar effectiveness to QRD

**Polycylindrical:**
- Half-cylinders
- Simpler construction
- 1D scattering
- Good for specific applications

**Effective Frequency Range:**
- Well/feature size determines lowest frequency
- Typical: 500Hz-10kHz
- Below 500Hz: Needs very large diffusers (impractical)
- Design frequency: 3× depth of wells

**Placement:**
- **Rear wall:** Primary location (behind listener)
- **Side walls:** Secondary (reduces lateral reflections)
- **Front wall:** Behind speakers (careful - can hurt imaging)
- **Ceiling:** Possible but can cause issues

**Diffusion vs Absorption:**
- Absorption: Removes energy, can deaden
- Diffusion: Maintains energy, controls reflections
- Balance needed: Absorb problem areas, diffuse others
- Not interchangeable: Different purposes

**Commercial Diffusers:**
- GIK Acoustics Alpha Series ($150-400 each)
- Vicoustic Multifuser ($200-500 each)
- Primacoustic Razorblade ($100-300 each)
- Expensive: 2-4× cost of absorption

**DIY Diffusers:**
- Complex construction (precise depths required)
- QRD calculators available online
- Material cost: $50-150 each
- Time-intensive build

**Professional Practice:** Secondary to absorption (install after bass traps and panels). Rear wall primary location. Maintains room liveliness. Check phase interaction with measurements.

### Cloud (Ceiling Treatment)
**Acoustic panel suspended from ceiling to control ceiling reflections.**

**Purpose:**
- Absorb ceiling reflections
- Prevent comb filtering from ceiling bounce
- Control vertical room modes
- First reflection point (vertical)

**Size and Placement:**
- **Size:** Typically 4'×8' to 4'×4' panel
- **Position:** Above listening position (mirror test on ceiling)
- **Height:** Suspended 6-18 inches from ceiling
- **Air gap:** Improves low-frequency absorption

**Construction:**
- Thick absorption (4-6 inches)
- Lightweight frame (safe suspension)
- Fabric covering
- Hanging system (cables, chains)

**Absorption Coefficient:**
- Thicker + air gap = better low-frequency absorption
- Can approach bass trap effectiveness
- Dual purpose: Reflection control + bass absorption

**Alternative to Cloud:**
- Ceiling-mounted panels (directly on ceiling)
- Less effective (no air gap)
- Easier installation
- Cheaper

**Professional Practice:** Cloud effective for ceiling reflections. Suspend 12"+ from ceiling for bass absorption. Position above listening position. 4'×6' or larger.

### Live End / Dead End (LEDE)
**Studio design philosophy: Absorptive front, diffusive rear.**

**Concept:**
- **Dead end (front):** Around speakers, absorptive, minimal reflections
- **Live end (rear):** Behind listener, diffusive, scattered reflections
- Controlled early reflections (front)
- Diffuse late reflections (rear)
- Improved stereo imaging and accuracy

**Front Half (Dead End):**
- Heavy absorption on side walls (first reflections)
- Absorption around speakers
- Minimal early reflections
- Tight stereo image

**Rear Half (Live End):**
- Diffusion on rear wall
- Some absorption (balance)
- Scattered late reflections
- Sense of space without problems

**Benefits:**
- Clear stereo image (controlled early reflections)
- Natural sound (diffuse late reflections)
- Balanced room (not too dead or live)
- Professional standard

**Challenges:**
- Requires treatment budget
- Needs sufficient room size
- Careful implementation
- Can sound odd if not done correctly

**Modern Variations:**
- Reflection-Free Zone (RFZ): Even more controlled
- Non-Environment: Maximum absorption everywhere
- Balanced: Mix of absorption/diffusion throughout

**Professional Practice:** LEDE effective in medium-large rooms. Front absorption critical. Rear diffusion maintains liveliness. Balance is key.

## 4. STUDIO MONITORING

### Studio Monitors (Near-Field)
**Speakers designed for accurate reproduction in close-range listening (1-3 meters).**

**Near-Field vs Far-Field:**
- **Near-field:** 1-3 meters listening distance, smaller speakers
- **Mid-field:** 2-4 meters, larger speakers, bigger rooms
- **Far-field:** 3-6+ meters, large speakers, professional rooms

**Why Near-Field:**
- More direct sound (less room interaction)
- Smaller rooms (practical size)
- Affordable (smaller = cheaper)
- Accurate (proper design)
- Standard in project studios

**Active vs Passive:**

**Active (Powered):**
- Built-in amplifiers
- Matched amp to driver
- No external amp needed
- Modern standard (90%+ of near-fields)
- Examples: Yamaha HS, KRK Rokit, Adam A7X

**Passive (Unpowered):**
- Require external amplifier
- More flexibility (choose amp)
- Traditional approach
- Rare in near-fields now
- Examples: Auratone 5C, Yamaha NS-10 (passive)

**Driver Configuration:**

**2-Way (Most Common):**
- Woofer (low-mid) + Tweeter (high)
- Crossover typically 2-3kHz
- Balanced, affordable
- Standard configuration

**3-Way:**
- Woofer + Midrange + Tweeter
- More complex crossover
- Better midrange accuracy
- More expensive
- Examples: Focal Solo6 Be, Genelec 1038

**Woofer Size:**
- **3-4 inch:** Very small rooms, supplemental
- **5 inch:** Small rooms, nearfield, common
- **6-7 inch:** Medium rooms, balanced
- **8 inch:** Larger rooms, more bass extension
- **10+ inch:** Large rooms, midfield

**Famous Studio Monitors:**

**Budget ($100-300/pair):**
- **PreSonus Eris E3.5/E4.5:** Entry level, $100-200

- **PMC IB1S:** Transmission line, detailed, $15,000+
- **Barefoot MicroMain27:** Complete monitoring, $10,000+

**Frequency Response:**
- **Full-range:** 40Hz-20kHz (ideal)
- **Typical near-field:** 50Hz-20kHz (-3dB points)
- **Small monitors:** 60-80Hz low end (need sub)
- Flat response critical (±3dB ideal)

**Professional Practice:** Near-field standard for mixing. Choose size for room. Flat response more important than extended bass. Yamaha HS series industry standard. Invest in quality (good monitors reveal problems).

### Monitor Placement
**Positioning speakers for optimal stereo imaging and frequency response.**

**Listening Triangle (Equilateral):**
- Speakers and listener form equilateral triangle
- Speaker-to-speaker distance = speaker-to-listener distance
- 60° angle at listening position (30° each speaker from center)
- Symmetrical (crucial for imaging)

**Distance from Walls:**
- **Front wall (behind speakers):** Minimum 1-2 feet
- **Side walls:** Minimum 2-3 feet
- **Symmetrical:** Same distance both sides
- Too close to walls: Bass buildup, comb filtering

**Height:**
- **Tweeter at ear level:** Critical (sit/stand position)
- Tilt if needed (angling down/up slightly)
- Consistent height (both speakers same)
- Stands vs desk: Stands preferred (decoupling)

**Toe-In (Angling):**
- **No toe-in (straight):** Wider image, less focused
- **Slight toe-in (15°):** Balanced (common)
- **Moderate toe-in (30°):** More focused, pointing at ears
- **Heavy toe-in (45°+):** Very focused, narrow sweet spot
- Recommended: Aim at point slightly behind head

**Symmetry:**
- Both speakers same distance from walls
- Same height
- Same angle
- Centered in room (left-right)
- Critical for imaging

**Avoiding Nulls/Modes:**
- Don't place speakers at room mode nulls
- Don't sit at room mode nulls
- 38% rule: Speaker and listening position at 38% of room length (approximation)
- Measure and adjust

**Decoupling:**
- **Isolation pads:** Auralex MoPad, IsoAcoustics
- Prevents desk vibration transmission
- Improves bass accuracy
- $50-150 for pair

**Professional Practice:** Equilateral triangle setup. Tweeters at ear level. Symmetrical placement (critical). Decouple from desk. Use isolation pads. Measure with REW and adjust.
