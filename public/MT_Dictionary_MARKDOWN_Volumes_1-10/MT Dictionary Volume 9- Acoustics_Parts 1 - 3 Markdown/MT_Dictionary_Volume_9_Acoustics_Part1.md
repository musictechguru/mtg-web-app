# PART 1: ACOUSTIC PRINCIPLES

## 1. Sound Physics & Propagation

### Sound Wave Definition
**Pressure variation traveling through medium (air) as longitudinal wave.**

**What is Sound:**
- Vibration of air molecules
- Compression and rarefaction cycles
- Requires medium (no sound in vacuum)
- Energy transfer through oscillation
- Perceived as pitch, loudness, timbre

**Sound Wave Properties:**
- **Frequency:** Pitch (Hz) - how fast wave oscillates
- **Amplitude:** Loudness (dB) - size of pressure variation
- **Wavelength:** Physical length of one cycle (meters)
- **Phase:** Position in cycle (degrees, 0-360°)
- **Velocity:** Speed through medium (343 m/s in air at 20°C)

**Frequency and Wavelength:**
- **Formula:** Wavelength (m) = Speed of Sound (343 m/s) / Frequency (Hz)
- **20Hz:** 17.15 meters (56 feet) - very long
- **100Hz:** 3.43 meters (11.25 feet)
- **1,000Hz (1kHz):** 0.343 meters (1.13 feet)
- **10,000Hz (10kHz):** 0.034 meters (1.35 inches) - very short
- **20,000Hz (20kHz):** 0.017 meters (0.67 inches)

**Why Wavelength Matters:**
- Low frequencies: Long wavelengths (hard to control, need large treatment)
- High frequencies: Short wavelengths (easy to control, small treatment works)
- Room dimensions: Must be several wavelengths for modes
- Absorption: Material thickness relates to wavelength

### Speed of Sound
**Velocity at which sound travels through air - temperature and medium dependent.**

**Speed in Air:**
- Standard: 343 m/s (1,125 ft/s) at 20°C (68°F)
- Varies with temperature: Faster when warmer
- Formula: v = 331.3 + (0.606 × T°C) m/s
- Independent of frequency (all frequencies travel same speed)

**Temperature Effects:**
- 0°C (32°F): 331 m/s (1,087 ft/s)
- 20°C (68°F): 343 m/s (1,125 ft/s) - standard reference
- 30°C (86°F): 349 m/s (1,145 ft/s)
- Every 1°C increase: ~0.6 m/s faster

**Other Media:**
- Water: 1,482 m/s (4× faster than air)
- Steel: 5,960 m/s (17× faster than air)
- Wood: 3,000-5,000 m/s
- Denser medium = faster sound

**Practical Applications:**
- Delay calculations (time = distance / 343)
- Acoustic treatment sizing
- Understanding room modes
- Speaker placement

**Example Calculation:**
- Distance: 10 meters
- Time: 10m / 343 m/s = 0.029 seconds = 29 milliseconds
- Speed of sound: ~1 foot per millisecond (rough approximation)

### Inverse Square Law
**Sound level decreases by 6dB for every doubling of distance from point source.**

**The Law:**
- Double distance: -6dB level reduction
- Halve distance: +6dB level increase
- Energy spreads over larger area (spherical)
- Natural attenuation with distance

**Distance vs Level Change:**
- 1 meter: 0dB (reference)
- 2 meters: -6dB
- 4 meters: -12dB
- 8 meters: -18dB
- 16 meters: -24dB

**Why It Matters:**

**Microphone Placement:**
- Twice as far: 6dB quieter
- Critical for gain staging
- Proximity effect (low frequency boost when close)

**Speaker Distance:**
- Listening position critical
- Sweet spot at specific distance
- Too far: Reduced direct sound, more room reflections
- Too close: Proximity effect, overwhelming bass

**Room Acoustics:**
- Direct sound vs reflected sound ratio
- Near field vs far field
- Critical distance concept

**Point Source vs Line Source:**
- Point source: -6dB per doubling (typical speakers)
- Line source: -3dB per doubling (line arrays)
- Real speakers: Between these (complex radiation)

**Professional Practice:** Understand distance-level relationship. Closer monitoring = more direct sound, less room. Speaker placement follows inverse square law.

### Reflection
**Sound waves bouncing off surfaces creating echoes and reverb.**

**How Reflection Works:**
- Sound wave hits surface
- Angle of incidence = angle of reflection
- Some energy absorbed, some reflected
- Frequency-dependent (highs reflect easily, lows less)

**Types of Reflections:**

**Specular Reflection:**
- Mirror-like reflection
- Smooth, hard surfaces
- Angle in = angle out
- Predictable behavior

**Diffuse Reflection:**
- Scattering in multiple directions
- Rough, irregular surfaces
- Breaks up reflections
- More natural sound

**Early Reflections:**
- First reflections (within 50ms)
- From nearby surfaces
- Define perceived room size
- Can cause comb filtering

**Late Reflections:**
- Arrive >50-100ms after direct
- Dense, diffuse
- Create reverb tail
- Sense of space

**Reflection Problems in Studios:**
- **Flutter echo:** Parallel walls (repetitive slap)
- **Slap-back:** Single distinct echo
- **Comb filtering:** Phase cancellation from reflections
- **Standing waves:** Room modes from reflections

**Solutions:**
- Absorption: Reduce reflections
- Diffusion: Scatter reflections
- Angled walls: Prevent parallel reflections
- Treatment placement: Target first reflection points

### Absorption
**Material property describing how much sound energy is converted to heat.**

**Absorption Coefficient:**
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
- Frequency-dependent (varies across spectrum)
- 0.0: Perfect reflection (no absorption)
- 1.0: Perfect absorption (no reflection)
- Real materials: 0.1-0.99 depending on frequency

**Absorption by Frequency:**

**Low Frequencies (50-200Hz):**
- Hard to absorb (long wavelengths)
- Requires thick, deep absorption
- Bass traps needed (2-4 feet deep)
- Membrane/panel absorbers effective

**Mid Frequencies (200Hz-2kHz):**
- Moderate absorption
- 2-4 inch panels effective
- Most porous absorbers work
- Easier than bass

**High Frequencies (2kHz-20kHz):**
- Easy to absorb (short wavelengths)
- Thin materials work (1-2 inches)
- Even curtains, carpet absorb
- Can over-absorb (dead sound)

**Common Materials (NRC - Noise Reduction Coefficient):**
- **Rockwool/Fiberglass (2"):** 0.50-0.70 NRC
- **Rockwool (4"):** 0.80-0.95 NRC
- **Acoustic foam (2"):** 0.30-0.50 NRC (mostly highs)
- **Heavy curtains:** 0.30-0.50 NRC
- **Carpet:** 0.20-0.40 NRC
- **Concrete wall:** 0.01-0.02 NRC (minimal)

**Porous Absorption:**
- Air friction in material
- Converts sound to heat
- Thickness matters (¼ wavelength rule)
- Fiberglass, rockwool, acoustic foam

**Panel/Membrane Absorption:**
- Resonant absorption (tuned frequency)
- Good for bass (low frequencies)
- Panel vibrates, absorbs energy
- Diaphragmatic absorbers

**Professional Practice:** Thick porous absorption for broadband. Bass traps for low frequencies. Balance absorption (don't over-deaden room). Target problem frequencies.

### Diffusion
**Scattering sound reflections to create even, natural acoustic environment.**

**What is Diffusion:**
- Breaks up coherent reflections
- Scatters sound in multiple directions
- Maintains energy (unlike absorption)
- Creates spacious, natural sound

**Diffusion vs Absorption:**
- **Absorption:** Removes energy (deadens)
- **Diffusion:** Redirects energy (maintains liveliness)
- **Absorption:** Can make room too dead
- **Diffusion:** Keeps room lively but controlled

**Types of Diffusers:**

**Quadratic Residue Diffuser (QRD):**
- Mathematical well depths
- Broadband diffusion
- Effective design
- Most common commercial diffuser

**Skyline Diffuser:**
- Varied heights/depths
- 2D diffusion pattern
- Aesthetic appeal
- Effective scattering

**Polycylindrical Diffuser:**
- Curved surfaces
- Semi-cylindrical columns
- Wide dispersion
- Simpler to build

**Binary Amplitude Diffuser:**
- On/off pattern (binary)
- Simpler construction
- Effective performance

**Effective Frequency Range:**
- Depends on well/column size
- Larger structures: Lower frequencies
- Typical: 500Hz-10kHz effective
- Below 500Hz: Needs larger diffusers

**Placement:**
- Rear wall behind listening position (primary)
- Side walls (secondary)
- Ceiling (careful - can cause issues)
- Behind speakers (reduces reflections)

**When to Use:**
- After addressing absorption needs
- Lively rooms needing control
- Recording studios (live end)
- Mixing rooms (balanced response)

**Professional Practice:** Use diffusion to maintain room liveliness while controlling reflections. Place after absorption installed. Rear wall behind listening position ideal. Balance diffusion and absorption.

### Standing Waves (Room Modes)
**Resonant frequencies where wavelengths fit perfectly between parallel surfaces creating peaks and nulls.**

**How They Form:**
1. Sound reflects between parallel walls
2. Wavelength fits exactly (integer multiples)
3. Reflections reinforce at certain frequencies
4. Creates peaks (high SPL) and nulls (low SPL) in room

**Modal Frequencies Formula:**
- **Axial mode:** f = (c × n) / (2 × L)
- c = speed of sound (343 m/s)
- n = mode number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- L = room dimension (length, width, or height)

**Example (Room 5m long):**
- 1st mode: (343 × 1) / (2 × 5) = 34.3 Hz
- 2nd mode: (343 × 2) / (2 × 5) = 68.6 Hz
- 3rd mode: (343 × 3) / (2 × 5) = 102.9 Hz
- Etc.

**Mode Types:**

**Axial Modes:**
- Between two parallel surfaces
- Strongest (most problematic)
- Length, width, height modes
- Most energy

**Tangential Modes:**
- Involve four surfaces
- Moderate strength
- Less problematic than axial
- Medium energy

**Oblique Modes:**
- Involve all six surfaces
- Weakest
- Least problematic
- Lowest energy

**Problems Caused:**
- **Peaks:** Excessive bass at modal frequencies
- **Nulls:** Missing bass at anti-nodes
- **Uneven response:** Room-dependent frequency response
- **Poor translation:** Mix sounds different in other rooms

**Room Dimension Ratios:**
- Avoid: Square rooms (all modes align)
- Avoid: 2:1 ratios (modes overlap)
- Good ratios: 1.6:1.1:1 (IEC recommendation)
- Good ratios: 1.4:1.9:1 (Louden)
- Golden ratio: 1.618:1:0.618

**Solutions:**
- **Bass traps:** Absorb modal energy (corners most effective)
- **Room ratios:** Design with good dimensional ratios
- **Speaker/listening position:** Avoid peaks and nulls
- **Multiple subwoofers:** Smooth modal response
- **DSP correction:** EQ to compensate (limited effectiveness)

**Professional Practice:** Calculate room modes. Place bass traps in corners (where modes strongest). Position listening/speakers to avoid worst peaks/nulls. Treat low frequencies first.

## 2. Room Acoustics

### Room Modes (Complete)
**Comprehensive understanding of axial, tangential, and oblique modes.**

**Critical Frequency Range:**
- Room modes: Below ~300Hz typically
- Above 300Hz: So many modes they blend (statistical field)
- Below 100Hz: Most problematic (fewer modes, more spacing)
- Sweet spot: 80-200Hz (treatment most needed)

**Mode Density:**
- Small rooms: Fewer modes, more spacing (problems)
- Large rooms: More modes, less spacing (smoother)
- Below Schroeder frequency: Modal behavior
- Above Schroeder frequency: Diffuse field

**Schroeder Frequency:**
- Transition between modal and diffuse field
- Formula: fs = 2000 × √(RT60 / V)
- RT60 = reverberation time (seconds)
- V = room volume (cubic meters)
- Below fs: Room modes dominate
- Above fs: Statistical (diffuse) field

**Mode Spacing:**
- Uneven spacing: Good (modes don't align)
- Even spacing: Bad (modes reinforce, square room)
- First five modes: Most critical
- Higher modes: Less problematic (more dense)

**Identifying Mode Problems:**
- Frequency sweep (sine wave generator)
- Walk around room listening
- Note frequencies that boom or disappear
- Measure with RTA (Real-Time Analyzer)
- These are modal frequencies

### RT60 (Reverberation Time)
**Time for sound to decay by 60dB after source stops.**

**Definition:**
- Standard acoustic measurement
- How "live" or "dead" room sounds
- Measured in seconds
- Frequency-dependent (different for different frequencies)

**RT60 Ranges:**

**Very Dead (0.1-0.3s):**
- Heavily treated
- Voice-over booths
- Dry, close sound
- Can feel unnatural

**Dead (0.3-0.5s):**
- Control rooms (mixing/mastering)
- Broadcast studios
- Accurate monitoring
- Professional standard

**Balanced (0.5-0.8s):**
- Tracking rooms
- Home studios
- Natural but controlled
- Versatile

**Live (0.8-1.5s):**
- Recording studios (live end)
- Small performance spaces
- Natural ambience
- Good for acoustic recording

**Very Live (1.5-3.0s+):**
- Concert halls
- Churches, cathedrals
- Orchestral recording
- Too live for mixing

**Target RT60 by Room Type:**
- **Control room (mixing):** 0.3-0.4s (tight, accurate)
- **Mastering room:** 0.2-0.3s (very controlled)
- **Tracking room:** 0.4-0.6s (some life)
- **Home studio:** 0.3-0.5s (balanced)
- **Voice-over booth:** 0.2-0.3s (very dry)

**Frequency-Dependent RT60:**
- Low frequencies: Often longer (harder to absorb)
- Mid frequencies: Target RT60
- High frequencies: Often shorter (easier to absorb)
- Goal: Flat across frequency (even decay)

**Sabine's Formula:**
- RT60 = 0.161 × V / A
- V = room volume (cubic meters)
- A = total absorption (sabins)
- Simplified calculation

**Measuring RT60:**
- Impulse response (balloon pop, clap)
- Sweep tone
- Dedicated measurement system (Room EQ Wizard - REW)
- Multiple positions (average)

**Professional Practice:** Target 0.3-0.4s for control rooms. Measure with REW or similar. Frequency-dependent (aim for flat). Too dead = fatiguing, too live = inaccurate.
