# PART 3: MICING TECHNIQUES

## General Micing Techniques

### Close Micing (Proximity Micing)
**Distance:** 1-12 inches from source.

**Advantages:**
- Maximum isolation from other sounds
- Reduced room acoustics
- More intimate/direct sound
- More gain before feedback (live)
- Control over sound

**Disadvantages:**
- Strong proximity effect (bass boost)
- Less natural sound
- Highly positional (small movement = big tone change)
- Misses room ambience
- Can emphasize flaws

**Applications:** Live sound, drum kit, guitar/bass amps, isolation needed.

**Technique:** Angle mic to control tone. High-pass filter for proximity effect. Use 3:1 rule with multiple mics.

---

### Distance Micing (Ambient Micing)
**Distance:** 1-15+ feet from source.

**Advantages:**
- Natural, realistic sound
- Room acoustics included
- Less proximity effect
- Position less critical
- Captures space

**Disadvantages:**
- Less isolation
- More room sound
- Lower direct-to-ambient ratio
- Phase issues with close mics

**Applications:** Acoustic instruments, orchestral, room mics, good-sounding rooms.

**Technique:** Listen in room first, place mic where sounds best.

---

### 3:1 Rule (Distance Rule)
**Guideline:** Distance between mics should be at least 3× distance from mic to source.

**Example:** Mic 4" from snare → next mic minimum 12" away.

**Why:** Minimizes phase cancellation, maintains level differences over time differences.

**Application:** Drum micing, multi-mic recordings, any multiple mics on sources.

---

### Phase Checking
**Process:** Solo individual mics → Add second mic → If thinner sound: phase issue.

**Solutions:**
- Phase invert button (flip polarity 180°)
- Time alignment (slide region)
- Microphone repositioning

**Critical:** Top/bottom snare, multiple drum mics, stereo techniques, room with close mics.

# PART 6: MICROPHONE TECHNOLOGY

## How Microphones Work

### Electromagnetic Induction (Dynamic)
Voice coil attached to diaphragm moves in magnetic field. Moving conductor through magnetic field generates voltage (Faraday's law). Voltage proportional to velocity of diaphragm. Simple, rugged, passive design. No power required. Less sensitive than condenser.

### Variable Capacitance (Condenser)
Two plates form capacitor: diaphragm (movable) and backplate (fixed). Fixed charge applied (via phantom power or permanent). Diaphragm movement changes capacitance. Capacitance change creates voltage change. Requires power and active electronics. Very sensitive, accurate.

### Pressure vs Velocity
**Pressure:** Responds to sound pressure (dynamic, condenser). **Velocity:** Responds to air particle velocity (ribbon). Velocity = naturally bidirectional (figure-8). Pressure = can be any pattern.

### Diaphragm Mass and Size
**Large Diaphragm (≥1"):** More mass, slower transient response, warmer character, lower self-noise per area. **Small Diaphragm (<1"):** Less mass, faster transients, more accurate, extended highs.

### Transducer Principles
**Moving Coil:** Electromagnetic induction. **Capacitor:** Variable capacitance. **Ribbon:** Electromagnetic induction (velocity). Each has unique character and applications.

## Microphone Accessories

### Pop Filter
Fabric screen preventing plosives (p, b, t sounds). Distance: 4-6" from mic. Essential for vocals. Reduces wind blast. Does NOT affect frequency response significantly.

### Shock Mount
Suspends mic in elastic bands/springs. Isolates from handling noise and vibration. Essential for: sensitive condensers, floor/stand vibrations. Reduces: low-frequency rumble.

### Windscreen/Foam
Foam cover reducing wind noise. Outdoor recording essential. Reduces: plosives slightly. Minimal frequency response effect. For heavy wind: blimp/zeppelin needed.

### Mic Stand Types
**Boom:** Horizontal extension (most versatile)
**Straight:** Vertical only
**Desktop:** Short, stable
**Overhead:** Tall for drums

### XLR Cables
Balanced 3-pin: ground, hot, cold. Rejects interference (common-mode rejection). Professional standard. Can be very long (100+ feet). Quality matters: shielding, connectors.
