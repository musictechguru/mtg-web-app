# PART 1 CONTINUED: MORE MICROPHONE TYPES

### Ribbon Microphone

**Technology/Operating Principle:**
Thin metal ribbon (aluminum typically, 2 microns thick - thinner than human hair) suspended in strong magnetic field. Sound pressure causes ribbon to vibrate → ribbon movement creates voltage through electromagnetic induction. Responds to **air velocity** not pressure (differentiates from dynamics/condensers).

**Construction:**
- Ultra-thin ribbon element (aluminum, sometimes duraluminum or nanofilm)
- Strong permanent magnets (neodymium typically, very powerful)
- Transformer (steps up voltage, matches impedance)
- Protective grille (screens ribbon from wind/pops)
- Figure-8 pattern natural to design (both sides of ribbon exposed)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Smooth, natural sound:** No harshness or edginess
- **Warm tonal quality:** Gentle high-frequency roll-off (natural)
- **Figure-8 pattern inherent:** Picks up front and back, rejects sides
- **Very low output:** Requires excellent preamp (60-70dB gain needed)
- **Fragile (vintage):** Can be damaged by shock, wind, phantom power
- **Modern ribbons:** More robust (some phantom-safe with active electronics)
- **No proximity effect in theory:** But practical designs have some

**Frequency Response:**
- Extended low end: Excellent bass response (30Hz and below)
- Smooth midrange: Very flat, natural
- Rolled-off highs: Natural above 12-15kHz (not a deficiency, part of character)
- No resonant peaks: Exceptionally smooth response curve

**Output Level:**
- Sensitivity: -54dBV/Pa to -60dBV/Pa or lower (much lower than dynamic)
- Requires: Excellent low-noise preamp with high gain capability
- Cloud Microphones Cloudlifter: Popular inline gain booster for ribbons
- Modern active ribbons: Built-in amplifier (higher output, phantom-powered)

**Applications:**
- **Vocals:** Smooth, intimate sound (especially male vocals, broadcast)
- **Guitar amplifiers:** Tames harshness, warm and smooth
- **String sections:** Warm, natural reproduction
- **Brass instruments:** Smooth out harsh overtones (trumpets, trombones)
- **Room microphones:** Smooth ambient capture
- **Drum overheads:** Warm cymbal sound
- **Any harsh source:** Needing smoothing and warmth

**Famous Examples:**

**Passive (Traditional):**
- **Royer R-121:** Modern standard for guitar amps, $1,295 (studio workhorse)
- **AEA R84:** Affordable ribbon, classic sound, $1,095 (great value)
- **Coles 4038:** BBC standard since 1950s, vintage sound, $1,695 (drums, orchestral)
- **Beyerdynamic M160:** Hypercardioid ribbon, $599 (drums, brass)
- **RCA 44/77-DX:** Vintage legends, $3,000-8,000 (collectors, museums)

**Active (Modern, Phantom-Powered):**
- **Royer R-122:** Active version of R-121, +12dB output, $1,595
- **AEA R44C:** Active version of RCA 44 design, $2,495
- **sE Electronics VR1/VR2:** Modern active ribbons, $499-699
- **Cascade Fathead II:** Active ribbon, affordable, $349

**Vintage Ribbon Care:**
- **Never use phantom power:** Can permanently damage ribbon element
- **Handle gently:** Avoid dropping, shock
- **Protect from wind:** Even breath can damage ribbon
- **Store upright:** Ribbon can sag if stored horizontally long-term
- **High-pass filter:** Use to protect from low-frequency rumble

**Modern Ribbons:**
- Phantom-power safe (most)
- More robust construction
- Some with active electronics (higher output)
- Nanofilm ribbons (stronger than aluminum)

**Typical Specifications:**
- Sensitivity: -54 to -60dBV/Pa (very low, need lots of gain)
- Max SPL: 130-145dB (depending on model, actually quite high)
- Frequency Response: 30Hz-15kHz typical (smooth roll-off)
- Impedance: 200-300Ω output (after transformer)
- Pattern: Figure-8 naturally (some models cardioid through design)
- Self-noise: N/A for passive (active models: 12-18dB SPL-A)

**Advantages:**
- Smoothest, most natural sound
- No harshness or edge
- Extended low-frequency response
- Excellent transient response
- Vintage character (highly sought)

**Disadvantages:**
- Very low output (needs excellent preamp)
- Fragile (vintage models especially)
- Limited high-frequency extension
- Figure-8 pattern not always ideal
- Expensive (quality models)

**Professional Wisdom:** "Ribbon mics make everything sound better." Often true - inherently smooth response. Perfect for taming harsh sources. Guitar amp staple. Requires investment in good preamp.

### Boundary Microphone (PZM - Pressure Zone Microphone)

**Technology:** Microphone element mounted very close to boundary surface (wall, floor, table). Uses boundary effect - no phase cancellation from reflected sound (capsule within 1/4 wavelength of surface).

**Design:** Omnidirectional or hemispherical pickup. Capsule facing down toward boundary plate. Typically condenser element.

**Characteristics:**
- No comb filtering from boundary reflections
- Clear, phase-coherent sound
- Hemispherical pickup pattern (half-sphere)
- Good for room/ambient capture
- Low profile (unobtrusive)

**Applications:** Conference rooms (on tables), stage floors (theater, orchestra), piano sound boards, room mics, kick drums (sometimes placed inside).

**Famous Models:** Crown PZM-30D ($299), Audio-Technica AT871R ($149), Shure MX393 ($279).

**Characteristics:**
- Highly directional (narrowest pattern available)
- Long interference tube (short tube = less directional)
- Used at distance (3-10+ feet)
- Picks up reflected sound (not magic - still gets room)

**Applications:** Film/video production (boom mic), wildlife recording, sports broadcasting, any distant source isolation needed.

**Famous Models:** Sennheiser MKH 416 ($999 - industry standard film), Rode NTG3 ($699), Audio-Technica AT875R ($169).

**Professional Note:** Not for studio/music recording typically. Designed for dialog and effects capture in film/TV.

# PART 2: POLAR PATTERNS COMPLETE

## Understanding Polar Patterns

**Polar Pattern Definition:** Graphical representation of microphone's sensitivity to sound from different directions. Shows how mic picks up sound from various angles (0° = front, 180° = rear, 90° = side).

**Graph Reading:** Circular diagram. 0° at top (front of mic), Distance from center = sensitivity, 0dB (outer circle) = maximum sensitivity, Inner circles = reduced sensitivity (-5dB, -10dB, -15dB, -20dB).
