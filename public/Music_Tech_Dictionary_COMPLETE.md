| **Bounce** | When multiple audio 'stems' are combined into one. |
| **Overdub** | Recording audio 'over the top' of pre-existing audio. Also known as multi-track recording. |
| **Patch** | A jargon-y word for a MIDI synth pre-set. Comes from when physical cables had to be 'patched' |
| **Playhead** | The line where the music is playing in Logic. |
| **Region** | The green boxes that contain the notes. |
| **Transport Bar** | Incorporates play, record and stop. |
| **Velocity** | How hard the notes are played. Affects timbres as well as volume. |
| **Bars, beats, divisions and ticks** | Bar = 4 beats. Beat = 1/4 note. Division = 1/16th note. Tick = 1/240th of a division (1/3840th of a beat!!). |

### Automation

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Read** | Logic plays back automation. |
| **Latch** | Records values that you change using playback and leaves them at that value (e.g. Pan -63) |
| **Touch** | Logic will record automation but as soon as you let go of the controls will jump back to the original position. |
| **Write** | Overrides everything. NEVER USE. |
| **MIDI Automation** | Records automation to MIDI file not just Logic. This will save the MIDI automation if the file is exported as .mid. These can then be opened in other DAWs |

### Studio Hardware

| Equipment | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Microphone** | Turns variations in air pressure into an electrical waveform. A form of transducer. A transducer converts one form of energy into another form of energy. |
| **Audio interface** | Converts Input audio to a digital code via a Analogue to Digital converter. The digital code is what is recorded by a DAW. |
| **Microphone pre-amps** | Gives an extra gain boost or reduction BEFORE the interface. Improves the signal to noise ratio and generally makes the recording sound great. |
| **DI Box (active/Passive)** | Direct injection – converts unbalanced instruments jack signals to be converted to a balanced XLR signal. Better signal to noise ratio and less chance of electromagnetic interference into the audio signal |
| **Mixing desk** | Turns multiple inputs into one stereo output. Enables you to add effects to separate channels such as EQ, pan, gain etc. |
| **Guitar pedals** | Foot-controlled effects units for guitars/bass. Can be daisy-chained with ¼ inch guitar jack leads. Connected in SERIES. |
| **Outboard effects (external effects unit)** | Physical effects units. Signal affected BEFORE interface/DAW. Uses the INSERTS on a mixing desk |
| **Digital Multi-tracker** | Precursor to computer based DAW's – piece of hardware that looks like a mixer with mixing capabilities and a hard-disk recorder attached. |
| **Drum machine** | A type of sampler/synth sequencer or hybrid which has presets specifically designed to sound like drums. |
| **Sampler** | Stores/triggers/edits pre-recorded sounds. An AKAI S1000 is an example |
| **Reverberation Unit** | Hardware reverb unit |
| **Compressor** | Hardware compressor |
| **EQ Unit** | Hardware EQ Unit that Boost/cut audio frequencies. |

### Other Things Found in the Studio

| Item | Description |

| **Patch bay** | A panel in the studio used for connecting different effects units/instruments. Stops you having to plug things in and out from the back. |
| **Control room** | Where the sound engineer can monitor recording from the live room where the musicians are playing and mix. |
| **Acoustic shields (or screen)/baffles** | Absorb sounds so there is less unwanted room noise/reverb. Also separates the sounds from different instruments playing at the same time. |
| **Sound/Isolation Booth** | Soundproof and very 'dry' room for recording soloists. Acoustically treated and insulated. 'Room within a room' which removes spillage. Most useful for drums (which spill a lot) and vocals (which need to be isolated) |

| **Looms/stage box or 'multi-core'** | Found in the live room and on a live stage. Extension lead for audio. Enables you to plug mics into the interface from a distance. |
| **'Return'** | Enables the performer to hear guide tracks and sounds via headphones or monitors. |

### Programming Environments

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|

| **Open Sound Control (OSC)** | A new protocol invented for synths and computers to communicate. Messages are transported across the internet using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) instead of MIDI allowing for more accuracy and flexibility. |

### New and Emerging Software on Music Production

| Software | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ableton Live** | Cross platform (PC & Mac). Has an amazing 'elastic audio' function that gives you great manipulation of audio samples. It's a 'sampler on steroids' |
| **MAWs** | Mobile audio workstation. E.g. Garage band on your phone. |
| **FL Studio** | PC based DAW that has some interesting functions and has an unusual layout that uses pattern based sequencing. |
| **Steinberg Cubase** | One of the first sequencers out there and what all modern sequencers are based on. A bit clunky these days. |

## 1.2 Microphones

### Gain

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Signal-to-noise ratio** | If a sound is recorded too quietly then you will have a poor signal to noise ratio. If you record at a good level but without clipping or distorting then that is a good signal to noise ratio. |
| **Clipping** | What happens when you have too much input gain and the sound becomes distorted. |
| **Interference and hiss** | This happens when you don't want it. There is noise in the audio signal. It could be interference from a light or computer, or it could be a dodgy guitar lead (probably is) |
| **Pre-amp controls** | Usually an input gain and output level control. Possibly have a PAD button for high level inputs and +48 Phantom power for condenser microphones |
| **Phantom Power** | How condenser microphones are powered from a mixing desk, D.I Box or audio interface. Sometimes referred to as +48V |
| **Pad** | Used to make a microphone less sensitive so they are less likely to clip on input - useful for loud signals (Drums) |
| **'Gain Structure'** | A good gain structure is when all the different input and output levels are nominal and not too loud or too quiet. |

### Mics and Their Characteristics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Capacitance/Condenser** | Sensitive, accurate microphone requiring phantom power (+48V). Best for vocals and acoustic instruments in studio. Captures detail and high frequencies well. |
| **Dynamic Mic** | Robust, less sensitive microphone needing no power. Best for loud sources (drums, guitar amps) and live use. Can handle high SPL. |
| **Cradle** | Shock mount. Isolates microphone from vibrations and handling noise. Essential for sensitive condenser mics. |
| **Rumble (Low pass) Filter** | High-pass filter (usually around 80-100Hz) to remove unwanted low frequency noise like air conditioning, traffic, or handling noise. |
| **Transient sounds** | Sounds with fast attack like drums or percussion. Condensers capture these better than dynamics due to faster diaphragm response. |
| **Polar Pick-up pattern** | The directional sensitivity of a microphone shown as a polar diagram. Shows which directions the mic picks up sound from. |
| **Cardioid** | Heart-shaped pickup pattern. Picks up sound from front, rejects from rear. Most common mic pattern. Good for isolating sound sources. |
| **Figure of 8 pattern** | Picks up equally from front and back, rejects from sides (90°). Good for two sources facing each other or room ambience. |
| **Hyper-cardioid** | Tighter than cardioid at front with small pickup lobe at rear. Better rejection from sides. Good for isolating sources in loud environments. |
| **Omni-directional** | Picks up equally from all directions (360°). Good for room ambience, orchestral recording, or natural sound. No proximity effect. |
| **Frequency Response** | The range of frequencies a mic can accurately capture. Measured in Hz. Flat response = accurate. Peaks/dips = coloured sound. |
| **Proximity Effect** | Bass frequency boost when sound source is very close (under 6 inches) to directional mics (cardioid/figure-8). Does not affect omni mics. |

### Micing Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Background noise** | Unwanted sound in recording environment. Minimize with directional mics, acoustic treatment, and careful mic placement. |
| **Spill** | When other sounds are picked up beyond the intended sound source. Unavoidable with multiple instruments but minimized with close micing and cardioid patterns. |
| **Plosives/sibilance** | Plosives = burst of air from 'p' and 'b' sounds causing loud pops. Sibilance = harsh 's' and 't' sounds. Use pop shield and de-esser to control. |
| **Ambient Recording** | Recording the natural sound of a space. Use omni mics or spaced pair positioned further from source to capture room acoustics. |
| **Close Micing** | Placing microphone very close (1-6 inches) to sound source for maximum isolation and detail. Reduces room sound and spill. |
| **On/Off Axis** | On-axis = mic pointing directly at source (bright). Off-axis = mic angled away (warmer, less bright). Use off-axis to reduce harshness. |
| **Stereo Pair** | Two microphones used together to create stereo image. Common techniques: X/Y (coincident), spaced pair (A/B), mid-side (M/S). |

### How to Mic Up Instruments

| Instrument | Mic + Pattern | Placement (distance) | Technique/Notes |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Electric Guitar** | SM57, Royer R-121 / Cardioid | 2-6" from speaker cone, on/off axis | Close mic on amp speaker. Off-axis gives warmer tone, on-axis brighter |
| **Bass Guitar** | AKG D112, RE20 / Cardioid | 2-6" from amp or DI box | Often blend mic + DI signal for clarity and punch. DI for definition, mic for tone |
| **Acoustic Guitar** | Small diaphragm condenser (AKG C451) / Cardioid | 6-12" pointed at 12th fret | Further back for more room sound, closer for detail and isolation |
| **Drum Overheads** | Small diaphragm condensers or ribbon mics / Cardioid or Figure-8 | 3-4 feet above kit, spaced pair or X/Y | Captures cymbals and overall kit balance. Experiment with height and width |
| **Snare** | SM57 (top) + SM57/condenser (bottom) / Cardioid | 1-2" from rim, angled toward center. Bottom mic underneath | Check phase between top and bottom mics. Flip phase on one if sounds thin |
| **Toms** | Sennheiser MD 421 or SM57 / Cardioid | 1-2" from rim, angled toward center | One mic per tom for isolation. Gate to reduce spill from other drums |
| **Kick Drum** | AKG D112, Beta 52, or RE20 / Cardioid | Inside drum or at port hole, 2-6" from beater | Inside for more attack/click, port hole for more tone and fullness |
| **Cello** | Large diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 1-2 feet away, aimed at f-holes or bridge | Further back captures more room tone, closer is more focused |
| **Violin** | Small diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 1-2 feet above and in front, angled downward | Avoid too close - causes harsh, scratchy sound |
| **Double Bass** | Large diaphragm condenser or DI/pickup / Cardioid | 6-12" from f-hole or bridge area | Can blend mic and DI/pickup signals for best of both worlds |
| **Brass (Trumpet/Trombone)** | Dynamic (SM57) or condenser / Cardioid | 6-12" from bell, slightly off-axis | Further for ensemble, closer for solo. Off-axis reduces harshness |
| **Flute/Clarinet** | Small diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 6-12" from keys/holes | Avoid aiming directly at mouthpiece - reduces breath and key noise |
| **Saxophone** | Dynamic or condenser / Cardioid | 6-12" from bell or above keys | Above keys captures full range nicely, bell gives more focused tone |
| **Vocals** | Large diaphragm condenser (Neumann U87, AKG C414) / Cardioid | 6-12" with pop shield | Pop shield reduces plosives. SM58 dynamic for live performances |
| **Backing Vocals** | Condenser or dynamic / Cardioid | 6-12" with pop shield | Can use one mic for multiple singers if grouped well around mic |
| **Congas** | Dynamic (SM57) or small diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 2-6" above rim, angled toward center | One mic per drum for isolation, or overhead pair for multiple congas |
| **Xylophones/Vibes** | Small diaphragm condenser pair / Cardioid | 1-2 feet above, spaced pair or X/Y | Stereo pair captures full width of instrument. Experiment with spacing |

### Advanced Micing Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Spaced/AB Pair** | Two mics (omni/cardioid) placed 3-10 feet apart pointing at source. Captures wide, natural stereo image but can have phase issues. Good for orchestras. |
| **X/Y or coincident pair** | Two cardioid mics at 90° angle with capsules as close as possible. Mono-compatible stereo with good imaging. No phase problems. |
| **M/S (mid side)** | One cardioid (mid) pointing at source, one figure-8 (side) perpendicular at 90°. Allows adjustment of stereo width in post-production. Excellent mono compatibility. |

### How Mics Actually Work

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Electro-magnetic induction** | In dynamic mics: Moving a conductor (diaphragm attached to coil) through magnetic field creates electrical current proportional to diaphragm movement. |
| **Front/back plate** | In condenser mics: front plate (diaphragm) moves with sound waves, back plate is fixed. Changing distance creates variable capacitance which generates electrical signal. |
| **Transducer** | Device that converts one form of energy to another. Microphones convert acoustic energy (sound pressure waves) to electrical energy (voltage). |
| **Diaphragm/membrane** | Thin material (plastic, metal) that vibrates sympathetically with sound waves. Its movement is converted to electrical signal by mic mechanism. |

## 1.3 Synthesis

### Parts of a Synthesiser

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Oscillator** | Generates an electrical waveform. Used in synths. Several oscillators can be blended/pitched to create different timbres. |
| **Cutoff/frequency** | The point (in Hz) at which the filter starts working. Below cutoff in LPF, above cutoff in HPF, or centered in BPF. |
| **Resonance** | A boost at the cutoff frequency of a filter. Creates a whistling, resonant sound. Adds emphasis and character. |
| **Envelope (Amplitude)** | Controls how sound changes over time. ADSR = Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. Shapes volume envelope. |
| **Sawtooth Wave** | Bright, buzzy waveform with all harmonics. Good for brass, strings, and basses. Very versatile. |
| **Ramp Wave** | Same as sawtooth but opposite direction (ramps down instead of up). Sounds identical to sawtooth. |
| **Sine Wave** | Pure tone with no harmonics. Fundamental frequency only. Sounds smooth and flute-like. |
| **Triangle wave** | Odd harmonics only. Softer than square wave. Good for flutes and soft leads. |
| **Square Wave** | Hollow, clarinet-like sound. Only odd harmonics. Good for leads and bass. |
| **White noise** | Hissing sound containing all frequencies at equal amplitude. Used for cymbals, wind effects, and sound design. |
| **Pink Noise** | All frequencies but with emphasis on lower frequencies (-3dB per octave). More natural sounding than white noise. Sounds like rumbling. |

| **Modulation Wheel** | Wheel on side of MIDI controller that can be routed/assigned to any parameter for real-time automation. Often controls vibrato depth. |
| **Assign/Route** | When you connect different parts of synthesizer or effects unit to each other. Modular synths use patch cables to physically route signals. |
| **Arpeggiator** | Software that turns chord into broken chord (arpeggio). Can change octave range and direction (up, down, up/down, random). |
| **Amplifier** | Part of synthesizer that amplifies signal. Final stage in synthesis process before output. |

### Other Parameters of a Synthesiser

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Voices** | Number of notes that can be played simultaneously. Monophonic = only one voice/note can be played at once. |
| **Glide (secs)** | Time in seconds to slide from one note to another. Also known as portamento. Creates smooth pitch transitions. |
| **Drive** | Overdrive on filter that boosts signal. Adds warmth, saturation and harmonic content. |
| **Legato** | Setting where attack/decay envelopes not retriggered after first note is played. Mimics slurring notes. Particularly noticeable with filter envelopes. |
| **Blend** | Amount of signal coming from each oscillator (e.g. 50% square, 50% sine). Mixes different waveforms together. |
| **Series/Parallel (filtering)** | Routing option for filters. Series = one filter after another. Parallel = both filters at same time. |
| **Detuning** | Makes all oscillators slightly out of tune with each other. Creates thicker sound as waves go out of phase, creating 'beating'. |
| **Coarse/fine tuning** | Coarse = tuning by semitones (12 per octave). Fine = tuning by cents (100 per semitone). |
| **Cents** | Increments between semitones. 1/100th of a semitone. 50 cents = quarter-tone (microtonal). |
| **2'/4'/8'/16'/32' (feet)** | Octaves on synth. Measured in 'feet', as originally organ pipes were measured by their length in feet. Middle C (261Hz) = 2' |
| **S/H (Sample and Hold)** | Samples a wave (e.g. sine) and holds signal at sampled value until next sample is taken. Creates stepped, random-sounding modulation. |
| **Polyphonic** | Synthesisers that can play more than one note at once. Typical voice counts: 4, 8, 16, or unlimited (digital). |
| **Bender Range** | Measured in semitones. How many semitones the pitch bend wheel will bend by. Typically ±2 semitones or ±12 semitones (1 octave). |
| **VCO/VCF** | Voltage Controlled Oscillator/Filter. The name for oscillators and filters on analogue synths. |
| **DCO/DCF** | Digitally Controlled Oscillator/Filter. The name for oscillators and filters on digital synths. More stable tuning. |
| **Subtractive synthesis** | Using harmonically complex oscillators (sawtooth, square) then putting them through filters to shape sound further. Most common type. |
| **Additive Synthesis** | Creating complex timbres by using multiple oscillators generating simple waveforms (sine waves) at different frequencies and amplitudes. |
| **Filter Envelope** | When an ADSR envelope is assigned to filter cutoff frequency. Creates dynamic filter movement over time. |
| **FM synthesis** | Frequency Modulation. Control output frequency of one oscillator (carrier) with another oscillator (modulator). Can produce elaborate timbral changes. Yamaha DX7 famous example. |

## 1.4 Sampling

### Editing Samples

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cutting/trimming/truncating** | Editing the length of a sample by removing unwanted sections from the start or end. |
| **Tuning samples** | Pitch affected by speeding up or slowing down samples. Faster = higher pitch, slower = lower pitch. |
| **Looping** | Repeating a section of sample to create endless sustained sound without clicks. Used for sustaining instrument notes. |
| **Cross/x-fade** | Fade out the end of loop as you fade in the beginning so there's no audible click. Creates smooth, seamless loop point. |
| **Zero-crossing point** | Slicing sample when amplitude is 0 (where waveform crosses X-axis). Avoids clicks when cutting or looping audio. |
| **Pitch Mapping/Transposing** | Using pitch shift insert to change pitch without speeding up or slowing down sample. Preserves timing. |

### More Sampling Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reversing** | Playing the sample backwards. Creates reverse reverb effect and interesting, unusual textures. |
| **Stuttering** | Re-triggering the beginning of sample repeatedly. Creates glitchy, rhythmic, modern effect. |
| **ADSR** | You can assign synthesizer ADSR envelopes to audio samples for dynamic control over amplitude. |
| **Pitch key zones** | Multi-sampling: where one sample is stretched over as many notes as possible without affecting timbre adversely. |
| **Velocity Layering** | Different samples assigned to different velocity ranges because there's a difference in timbre at different playing dynamics. X-fade between samples for smooth transitions. |
| **Time Stretching** | Change length of sample but pitch stays same. Measured in %. 100% = normal speed, 50% = half speed, 200% = double speed. |
| **Binary** | Number system used by computers. Expresses numbers using only 0s and 1s. All digital audio stored as binary code. |
| **Multi-sampling** | Sample covers only a limited range of notes to maintain authentic timbre. Different samples recorded for different pitch ranges. |
| **Bit Depth** | Amount of information per sample when analogue is converted to digital. How accurately the amplitude is recorded. 16-bit = 65,536 levels, 24-bit = 16.7 million levels. Affects dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio. |
| **Quantization Error** | Occurs when bit depth is too low. Represents sampled values of amplitude by finite set of levels, converting continuous-amplitude wave into discrete-time signal. |
| **Dithering** | Solution to quantization error when bit depth is too low. Introduction of small amounts of randomly generated noise in A/D conversion process. Randomizes effect of quantization error. |
| **Floppy disc** | Old storage system. Magnetic disc in plastic housing. Very low capacity (~1.44MB). Now obsolete. |
| **Sample Rate** | The number of samples per second. Sample rate affects frequency response. Lower sample rate means high/low frequencies aren't captured. 44.1kHz standard for CD. |
| **Nyquist Theory** | The sample rate should be double the desired frequency response (or double the highest frequency you want to hear). For 20kHz audio, need 40kHz+ sample rate. |
| **Aliasing** | Occurs when sample rate is too low. High frequencies (within audible range) are incorrectly recreated. Results in unwanted artifacts and distortion. |
| **Artefacts** | Unwanted sonic material (sound) introduced into audio as result of things like aliasing, low bit depth, or processing errors. |

| **8-Bit** | Enables 128 different values to be expressed in MIDI through 8-digit binary. Only 7 numbers available because first byte tells if message is status or data byte, other 7 allow 128 values (2^7). |
| **Channel/Event message** | All messages sent to individual channels (1-16). Types: Note info (Note On/Off), Controller change (CC), Pitch bend. Communicated as 'status byte'. |
| **'Notes' Channel message** | Contains info on: 1) It's a note message (Status), 2) Note pitch (Data byte 1), 3) Velocity (Data byte 2). Note length sent when 'note off' received. |
| **Controller Channel message** | Contains: 1) It's a controller message (status), 2) Which controller number (Data byte 1), 3) Value of controller (Data byte 2). |
| **Continuous controller** | Controller that gradually changes over time from 0-127. Examples: Volume (CC7), Pan (CC10), Expression (CC11). |

| **MIDI IN/OUT/THRU** | **IN**: Receives MIDI data from sequencer or other device. **OUT**: Sends data generated within device (keys, knobs, internal sequencer) plus anything from MIDI IN. **THRU**: Duplicates only what's entering from MIDI IN, for daisy-chaining devices. |
| **Jitter** | Inconsistency in timing between MIDI events. Causes timing to be unsteady, notes don't align perfectly. |
| **Latency** | Constant delay between note being played on controller and it sounding. Caused by slow computer (not enough RAM/CPU). |
| **Format 0, 1 & 2** | The 3 formats MIDI files are saved in. Format 0 = single track. Format 1 = multiple tracks. Format 2 = multiple independent sequences. |
| **Status byte** | The status of the message (Note On, Note Off, Controller, etc.). Always has 1 at beginning, leaving 7 spaces for 0-127 range: 1xxxxxxx |
| **Databyte 1** | The 'Num' (number) channel in list editor. Always has 0 at beginning, leaving 7 spaces for 0-127 range: 0xxxxxxx. Indicates which note or controller. |
| **Databyte 2** | The 'Val' (value) channel in list editor. Always starts with 0, leaving 7 spaces for 0-127 range: 0xxxxxxx. Indicates velocity or controller value. |
| **MSB/LSB (in pitch bend)** | Most Significant Byte / Least Significant Byte. Combines values of Data byte 1 and 2 for 14-bit resolution: 0xxxxxxx + 0xxxxxxx = 128 x 128 = 16,384 different values. Gives smooth pitch bend without stepping between notes. |

## 1.9 Dynamic Processing

### Advanced Dynamic Processors

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Limiter** | A compressor with ratio of ∞:1 (infinity to one). Also known as brick wall compressor. Stops signal exceeding threshold completely. |
| **Expander** | Instead of decreasing dynamic range, it increases dynamic range. Opposite of compressor. Makes quiet sounds quieter and loud sounds louder. |
| **De-esser** | Removes sibilance by attenuating specific high frequencies (typically 5-8kHz) when they exceed threshold. Specialized compressor. |
| **Pumping** | Rhythmic 'breathing' effect created when sidechain compression is used. Kick drum triggering compression on bassline, for example. |

### Compressor Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Knee (hard/soft)** | Compresses signal near threshold by different amounts. **Soft knee**: gradual compression onset. **Hard knee**: abrupt compression at threshold. |
| **Threshold** | The level (in dB) at which compressor starts working. Signals above threshold are compressed. |
| **Attack (ms)** | Time it takes for compressor to start working once signal has gone over threshold. Fast attack = transients reduced. Slow attack = transients preserved. |
| **Release (ms)** | Time it takes for compressor to stop working once signal has gone below threshold. Affects how compression recovers. |
| **Ratio** | Amount of compression. 4:1 = for every 4dB over threshold, output increases by 1dB. Higher ratio = more compression. |
| **Circuit Type** | Pre-sets in Logic emulating famous compressors (Urei 1176, Fairchild 670, SSL bus compressor, etc.). Different sonic characteristics. |
| **Stereo Link** | Links two compressors for left and right channels so they compress identically. Prevents stereo image shifting. |
| **Multiband compression** | Compresses different frequency bands independently. Bass, mids, and highs can be compressed by different amounts. |
| **Side-chaining** | Compressor triggered by external signal rather than signal being compressed. Classic example: kick drum triggering bass compression. |

### Noise Gate Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Threshold** | Point at which sound is attenuated. Sounds must go over threshold for gate to open and pass signal. |
| **Range/Reduction** | Amount (in dB) the signal below threshold is attenuated by. -60dB = complete silence when gate closed. |
| **Attack (ms)** | Time taken for gate to open once signal passes threshold. Too fast can cause clicks. |
| **Hold (ms)** | Time gate is held open after signal has gone below threshold. Prevents chattering. |
| **Release (ms)** | Time it takes for gate to close once hold time is up. Too fast causes abrupt cuts. |
| **Monitor** | Solo mode to hear the signal that's triggering the gate. Used to locate specific frequencies. |
| **Side-chain** | Gate triggered by external sound rather than signal being gated. Example: kick drum triggering gate on room mics. |
| **Ducking** | When one signal is attenuated due to presence of another. Example: DJ voice ducking music, or podcast voice ducking background music. |

### Reverb

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reverb** | Effect that simulates acoustic space by adding reflections and decay tail. After sound is made, it dissipates and reflects off surfaces. Creates sense of depth and space. |
| **Spring Reverb** | Reverb time determined by tension of springs. Sound played through drive transducers, reverberates through springs, picked up by pickups. Often found in guitar amps (e.g. Fender). |
| **Plate reverb** | Sound played through drive transducers into large metal plate (4x8 feet). Wet sound picked up by contact pickups. Reverb time controlled by dampening pads touching plate. Classic on vocals (Abbey Road Studios). |
| **Echo Chamber** | Dry sound played through speaker in one corner of reflective room, wet sound recorded by mic at other end. Reverb altered by changing surfaces and moving speaker/mic. High-end reverb. |
| **Digital reverb** | Uses algorithms (computer rules) combining delay/echo/feedback/filtering to emulate real spaces. Most flexible and common today. |
| **Room Size** | The bigger the room, the longer the pre-delay and reverb time. Small room = tight, intimate. Large room/hall = spacious, epic. |
| **Reverb time (seconds)** | Time it takes for reverb to decay to silence (or -60dB). Short (0.5-1s) = small room. Medium (1-2s) = hall. Long (2-5s+) = cathedral. |

### Reverb Advanced Parameters

| **Impulse Response** | Sampled reverb tail of sound in specific acoustic space (concert hall, bathroom, cave). Can be applied to any audio to emulate that exact space. |
| **Excitation signal** | Test signal (usually white noise burst or sine sweep) used to record impulse response of space. Captures how space responds to all frequencies. |
| **Natural Reverb** | Acoustic reverb captured naturally during recording by placing microphones further from source in acoustically good space. Most authentic but least controllable. |
| **Dampening Pad** | Felt pads on plate reverb that physically touch the plate to control decay time. More contact = shorter reverb time, less sustain. |
| **Reverb time graph** | Visual representation showing how reverb decays over time. Shows reflection density building up and gradual decay. |
| **RT60** | Reverb Time 60. Official measurement: time in seconds for reverb to decay by 60dB. Standard for measuring reverberation in rooms. |
| **Pre-delay** | Time delay between dry signal and first early reflections. Creates separation between source and reverb. Longer pre-delay = perception of larger space. Typical: 10-50ms. |
| **Early reflections** | First reflections that reach listener after direct sound. Arrive within ~80ms. Create perception of room size and shape. Distinct from later reverb tail. |

### Delay

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Delay Time (ms) (repeat rate)** | Time between delay repeats in milliseconds. Short (1-50ms) = doubling/thickening. Medium (50-250ms) = distinct slap. Long (250ms+) = rhythmic echo. |
| **Feedback (in %)** | The number of repeats/echoes. Low feedback (10-30%) = 1-3 repeats. High feedback (70%+) = many repeats fading out. 100%+ = infinite repeats building up. |
| **Tempo Delay/timed delay/sync** | Rhythm of repeats synchronized to project tempo. Values like 1/4 note, 1/8 note, dotted 1/8, etc. Creates musical, in-time delays. |
| **Low cut/high cut** | Filters applied to wet delayed signal only. High-pass to reduce muddiness, low-pass for darker, more vintage repeats. |
| **Bass/Treble** | Simple EQ controls for delayed signal. Shape tone of repeats without affecting dry signal. |
| **Mono Delay** | Only one wet signal output. Simple, focused delay. Takes less CPU and mixing space. |
| **Stereo Delay** | Left and right delay channels can be treated independently. Different delay times, feedback, filtering per side. Creates wider image. |
| **Pingpong Delay** | Panned delay where sound bounces between left and right speakers. Creates animated stereo movement. Classic in electronic music. |
| **Multitap delay** | Create multiple delay taps with independent timing. Can create custom rhythms by setting multiple delay times manually. Very flexible. |

| **LFO (in delay)** | Adds modulation effect to delayed signal (vibrato/chorus effect on repeats). Creates pitch variation. Makes delay more interesting and vintage-sounding. |
| **Freeze** | Captures current delay repeats and holds/sustains them indefinitely while freeze is engaged. Creates ambient pad textures from rhythmic delays. |

### Basics of Modulated Delay

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Depth (Or intensity)** | A = amplitude of LFO modulation. How much the parameter (pitch, time, filter) is modulated. Higher depth = more extreme, noticeable effect. |
| **Rate (Hz)** | Speed of LFO modulation in Hertz (cycles per second). Higher rate = faster modulation. Can also be synced to tempo (BPM). |
| **¼ inch jack** | Unbalanced instrument cable used to connect guitar pedals. Mono (TS) cable with tip and sleeve. |
| **9V battery** | Standard power source for many guitar effects pedals. Some pedals use power supply (Boss-style 9V DC adaptor). |
| **Daisy Chaining** | Connecting multiple effect pedals in series using patch cables. Signal flows through chain: guitar → pedal 1 → pedal 2 → pedal 3 → amp. |
| **Phase Cancellation** | When two identical or similar signals combine out of phase, certain frequencies are reduced or eliminated. Results in thin, hollow sound. |
| **LFO Wave** | Shape of low frequency oscillator. **Sine** = smooth. **Triangle** = linear. **Square** = abrupt. **Random** = unpredictable. Affects character of modulation. |

### Flange

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flanging** | Effect created by mixing two identical signals where one has very short delay (5-20ms) modulated by LFO. Creates sweeping, whooshing, jet-plane sound. Creates comb filter. |
| **Rate (Hz)** | Speed of LFO modulating the delay time. Slow (0.1-1Hz) = gentle sweep. Fast (5-10Hz) = aggressive, dizzy effect. |
| **Depth (Or intensity) / Width** | How much the delay time is modulated. Greater depth = more dramatic sweep effect, more pronounced peaks and troughs in comb filter. |
| **Feedback or Resonance (Res)** | Amount of effected signal fed back into input. Higher feedback = more intense, metallic, resonant flanging. Can self-oscillate at extreme settings. |
| **Manual** | Sets the center delay time of the flange without modulation. Like parking the flanger at specific position for static comb filtering. |
| **Comb filter** | Frequency response graph that looks like teeth of a comb - series of peaks and notches at harmonic intervals. Created by combining delayed signals. Flanging creates moving comb filter. |

## Music Styles

### Jazz
**Instruments:** Acoustic piano, upright bass (or electric), drums (often with brushes), saxophone, trumpet, trombone, guitar (hollow-body)

**Sounds:** Natural, warm acoustic tones. Room ambience important. Clean, minimal processing. Drum brushes give soft, swishing texture. Complex harmonies and improvisation.

**Production:** Live room recording prioritizing natural acoustics. Minimal overdubs - capture ensemble performance. Spaced mic techniques for natural sound. Light compression to preserve dynamics. Minimal EQ - just corrective. Preserve dynamic range and expression.
