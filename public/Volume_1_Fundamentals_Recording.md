| **Dynamic Processing** | An effect that deals with level, amplitude or volume |
| **Envelope (ADSR)** | A way of automating the shape of a sound, most commonly through the amplitude and 'ADSR' controls |
| **Equalisation (EQ)** | An insert effect that can alter the timbre (tone) of the input sound using filters. |
| **Filter** | An effect that boosts or cuts frequencies within a spectrum in order to shape the timbre (tone) of a sound. |
| **Insert** | An effect that is added in 'series' within a signal chain. i.e. one effect after another (NOT Parallel!) |

| **Stereo** | An audio track that has both left and right channels played at the same time. |
| **Sustain** | The volume/amplitude of the note when it is held. |
| **Synthesis** | A process of creating sounds using an combination of oscillators which create waveforms (such as sine & square) and tone shaping processes e.g. filter & ADSR envelope |
| **Pan** | Short for 'panorama'. Sending sound to left and right channels (speakers) independently. |
| **Recording Studio** | A place where you record sound, usually comprised of a live room (for your musicians) and control room (for your recording engineer and producers) |

## 1.1 Recording and Production Techniques

### DAW Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Auto Punch in** | When you set a DAW to record for a short window in order to correct mistakes recording audio. |
| **Bounce** | When multiple audio 'stems' are combined into one. |
| **Overdub** | Recording audio 'over the top' of pre-existing audio. Also known as multi-track recording. |
| **Patch** | A jargon-y word for a MIDI synth pre-set. Comes from when physical cables had to be 'patched' |
| **Playhead** | The line where the music is playing in Logic. |
| **Region** | The green boxes that contain the notes. |
| **Transport Bar** | Incorporates play, record and stop. |
| **Velocity** | How hard the notes are played. Affects timbres as well as volume. |
| **Bars, beats, divisions and ticks** | Bar = 4 beats. Beat = 1/4 note. Division = 1/16th note. Tick = 1/240th of a division (1/3840th of a beat!!). |

### Automation

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Read** | Logic plays back automation. |
| **Latch** | Records values that you change using playback and leaves them at that value (e.g. Pan -63) |
| **Touch** | Logic will record automation but as soon as you let go of the controls will jump back to the original position. |
| **Write** | Overrides everything. NEVER USE. |
| **MIDI Automation** | Records automation to MIDI file not just Logic. This will save the MIDI automation if the file is exported as .mid. These can then be opened in other DAWs |

### Studio Hardware

| Equipment | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Microphone** | Turns variations in air pressure into an electrical waveform. A form of transducer. A transducer converts one form of energy into another form of energy. |
| **Audio interface** | Converts Input audio to a digital code via a Analogue to Digital converter. The digital code is what is recorded by a DAW. |
| **Microphone pre-amps** | Gives an extra gain boost or reduction BEFORE the interface. Improves the signal to noise ratio and generally makes the recording sound great. |
| **DI Box (active/Passive)** | Direct injection – converts unbalanced instruments jack signals to be converted to a balanced XLR signal. Better signal to noise ratio and less chance of electromagnetic interference into the audio signal |
| **Mixing desk** | Turns multiple inputs into one stereo output. Enables you to add effects to separate channels such as EQ, pan, gain etc. |
| **Guitar pedals** | Foot-controlled effects units for guitars/bass. Can be daisy-chained with ¼ inch guitar jack leads. Connected in SERIES. |
| **Outboard effects (external effects unit)** | Physical effects units. Signal affected BEFORE interface/DAW. Uses the INSERTS on a mixing desk |
| **Digital Multi-tracker** | Precursor to computer based DAW's – piece of hardware that looks like a mixer with mixing capabilities and a hard-disk recorder attached. |
| **Drum machine** | A type of sampler/synth sequencer or hybrid which has presets specifically designed to sound like drums. |
| **Sampler** | Stores/triggers/edits pre-recorded sounds. An AKAI S1000 is an example |
| **Reverberation Unit** | Hardware reverb unit |
| **Compressor** | Hardware compressor |
| **EQ Unit** | Hardware EQ Unit that Boost/cut audio frequencies. |

### Other Things Found in the Studio

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Monitors / 'Monitoring'** | The speakers or headphones that are used to listen to the output of your mixer or DAW |
| **Patch bay** | A panel in the studio used for connecting different effects units/instruments. Stops you having to plug things in and out from the back. |
| **Control room** | Where the sound engineer can monitor recording from the live room where the musicians are playing and mix. |
| **Acoustic shields (or screen)/baffles** | Absorb sounds so there is less unwanted room noise/reverb. Also separates the sounds from different instruments playing at the same time. |
| **Sound/Isolation Booth** | Soundproof and very 'dry' room for recording soloists. Acoustically treated and insulated. 'Room within a room' which removes spillage. Most useful for drums (which spill a lot) and vocals (which need to be isolated) |
| **TRS Jack** | Tip/Ring/Sleeve (TRS). Balanced stereo jack. See section 2.3 leads and signals for more info |
| **XLR (cannon)** | Balanced 3 pin lead. Used for mics and reduces hum. See 2.3. |
| **Mic Stand** | A stand. For mics. |
| **Clip** | The important bit that attaches the microphone to the mic stand that everyone forgets about. |
| **Pop Shield** | Filters out 'plosives and sibilance when singers sing |
| **Jack Lead** | Used to connect guitars to amps. It is unbalanced (not TRS) |
| **Looms/stage box or 'multi-core'** | Found in the live room and on a live stage. Extension lead for audio. Enables you to plug mics into the interface from a distance. |
| **'Return'** | Enables the performer to hear guide tracks and sounds via headphones or monitors. |

### Programming Environments

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **MIDI** | Musical Instrument Digital Interface. A protocol (computer language) which expresses musical performance in numerical form (binary). Allows all DAWs and synths/samplers made by different manufacturers to communicate through a globally understood language. |
| **Open Sound Control (OSC)** | A new protocol invented for synths and computers to communicate. Messages are transported across the internet using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) instead of MIDI allowing for more accuracy and flexibility. |

### New and Emerging Software on Music Production

| Software | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ableton Live** | Cross platform (PC & Mac). Has an amazing 'elastic audio' function that gives you great manipulation of audio samples. It's a 'sampler on steroids' |
| **MAWs** | Mobile audio workstation. E.g. Garage band on your phone. |
| **FL Studio** | PC based DAW that has some interesting functions and has an unusual layout that uses pattern based sequencing. |
| **Steinberg Cubase** | One of the first sequencers out there and what all modern sequencers are based on. A bit clunky these days. |
| **Studio One** | A pattern based sequencer from Presonus. Works with presonus hardware |

### Types of Mixer

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Live sound mixer** | Used to combine all the audio inputs from the stage and output to the PA speakers. Usually contains effects that can be added to different channels. Can be completely analogue or digital where you can add digital effects and save presets for different scenes. |
| **Recording Mixer** | Modern ones are digital and used to sync with DAWs. They have flying faders to connect with the DAW so essentially they are a very, very expensive mouse. |

### Mixer Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pot** | The knob on mixers which are called potentiometers. |
| **Bus** | Sends the output signal of a channel to an auxiliary (spare or 'aux' channel before the output). |
| **Peak Meter (LED)** | Measures the highest signal peaks of an audio output. Colours show if the signal is clipping or not. |
| **VU (Volume Unit) Meter** | A weird way of measuring average loudness instead of peak levels. Useful for mastering. See 2.4 levels for more detail. |
| **Channel Fader** | Used to boost or cut the audio signal after the gain stage and the inserts. |
| **Phase Reverse Ø** | Switches the polarity of the signal to avoid cancellation of frequencies. Used when miking up the same instrument/drum with two mics or during a stereo recording. |
| **Solo/PFL** | Solo = only the track(s) soloed are outputted (post fader). Found in DAWs. PFL = 'Pre-fade listen'. Found on analogue mixers. Solos the track, but bypasses the fader and only solos the track for the monitoring/headphones, not the master output. Useful for line checking the input gain as it ignores the fader. |
| **Group Faders** | Like a track stack in logic. Send many channels to a group fader (e.g. all the drum mics) and you can control all the drums on one fader. |
| **'Line'/'Mic'/'instrument input'** | Different input types. See 2.3 Leads and signals (impedance) for more detail |
| **Insert** | A signal loop for inputting effects like compressors into a signal chain. |
| **Tape** | This is an output to tape machine, for analogue recording. |
| **Trim/gain** | Boosts or cuts the input signal. |
| **Hi mid/lo mid etc** | The EQ is split up into bands that can be affected separately |
| **Q** | The bandwidth of the filter. |
| **Aux Sends** | Allows you to send the signal to an auxiliary channel which, for example, has reverb on. |
| **Pan** | Left and Right in the stereo field |
| **Flying faders** | Faders attached to moving parts that can be connected to DAWs or digital recordings. |
| **Master out** | The main (often stereo) output of L and R channels. |
| **Talk Back Mic** | How sound engineers talk to musicians in the separate live room |

### Controls of an Interface

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gain/Trim** | How you change the input level into an audio interface. |
| **Headroom** | The amount of level/gain you have available before you get distortion on your audio. Sometimes distortion is a good thing. |
| **Clock sync** | A common clock that all devices run to in order to play together in time. |
| **Kettle Socket** | Also known as a 'euroboot' power socket - Which I prefer. |
| **ADAT (optical in)** | Also known as a 'lightpipe'. The ADAT cable allows up to 8 tracks of digital audio. It's used to connect different pieces of music tech equipment together |
| **FIREWIRE** | Another type of connector that nobody uses anymore. Favoured by Apple Macs |
| **Main Out** | Your main audio output from your audio interface. You connect your speakers or headphones to this output so you can hear what you are doing. |
| **XLR input** | Where you plug in microphones. |
| **Combi-input** | You can also plug guitar cables into these. Don't forget about the locking tabs…. |

## 1.2 Microphones

### Gain

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Signal-to-noise ratio** | If a sound is recorded too quietly then you will have a poor signal to noise ratio. If you record at a good level but without clipping or distorting then that is a good signal to noise ratio. |
| **Clipping** | What happens when you have too much input gain and the sound becomes distorted. |
| **Interference and hiss** | This happens when you don't want it. There is noise in the audio signal. It could be interference from a light or computer, or it could be a dodgy guitar lead (probably is) |
| **Pre-amp controls** | Usually an input gain and output level control. Possibly have a PAD button for high level inputs and +48 Phantom power for condenser microphones |
| **Phantom Power** | How condenser microphones are powered from a mixing desk, D.I Box or audio interface. Sometimes referred to as +48V |
| **Pad** | Used to make a microphone less sensitive so they are less likely to clip on input - useful for loud signals (Drums) |
| **'Gain Structure'** | A good gain structure is when all the different input and output levels are nominal and not too loud or too quiet. |

### Mics and Their Characteristics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Capacitance/Condenser** | Sensitive, accurate microphone requiring phantom power (+48V). Best for vocals and acoustic instruments in studio. Captures detail and high frequencies well. |
| **Dynamic Mic** | Robust, less sensitive microphone needing no power. Best for loud sources (drums, guitar amps) and live use. Can handle high SPL. |
| **Cradle** | Shock mount. Isolates microphone from vibrations and handling noise. Essential for sensitive condenser mics. |
| **Rumble (Low pass) Filter** | High-pass filter (usually around 80-100Hz) to remove unwanted low frequency noise like air conditioning, traffic, or handling noise. |
| **Transient sounds** | Sounds with fast attack like drums or percussion. Condensers capture these better than dynamics due to faster diaphragm response. |
| **Polar Pick-up pattern** | The directional sensitivity of a microphone shown as a polar diagram. Shows which directions the mic picks up sound from. |
| **Cardioid** | Heart-shaped pickup pattern. Picks up sound from front, rejects from rear. Most common mic pattern. Good for isolating sound sources. |
| **Figure of 8 pattern** | Picks up equally from front and back, rejects from sides (90°). Good for two sources facing each other or room ambience. |
| **Hyper-cardioid** | Tighter than cardioid at front with small pickup lobe at rear. Better rejection from sides. Good for isolating sources in loud environments. |
| **Omni-directional** | Picks up equally from all directions (360°). Good for room ambience, orchestral recording, or natural sound. No proximity effect. |
| **Frequency Response** | The range of frequencies a mic can accurately capture. Measured in Hz. Flat response = accurate. Peaks/dips = coloured sound. |
| **Proximity Effect** | Bass frequency boost when sound source is very close (under 6 inches) to directional mics (cardioid/figure-8). Does not affect omni mics. |

### Microphone Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Background noise** | Unwanted sound in recording environment. Minimize with directional mics, acoustic treatment, and careful mic placement. |
| **Spill** | When other sounds are picked up beyond the intended sound source. Unavoidable with multiple instruments but minimized with close micing and cardioid patterns. |
| **Plosives/sibilance** | Plosives = burst of air from 'p' and 'b' sounds causing loud pops. Sibilance = harsh 's' and 't' sounds. Use pop shield and de-esser to control. |
| **Ambient Recording** | Recording the natural sound of a space. Use omni mics or spaced pair positioned further from source to capture room acoustics. |
| **Close Micing** | Placing microphone very close (1-6 inches) to sound source for maximum isolation and detail. Reduces room sound and spill. |
| **On/Off Axis** | On-axis = mic pointing directly at source (bright). Off-axis = mic angled away (warmer, less bright). Use off-axis to reduce harshness. |
| **Stereo Pair** | Two microphones used together to create stereo image. Common techniques: X/Y (coincident), spaced pair (A/B), mid-side (M/S). |

### How to Mic Up Instruments

| Instrument | Mic + Pattern | Placement (distance) | Technique/Notes |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Electric Guitar** | SM57, Royer R-121 / Cardioid | 2-6" from speaker cone, on/off axis | Close mic on amp speaker. Off-axis gives warmer tone, on-axis brighter |
| **Bass Guitar** | AKG D112, RE20 / Cardioid | 2-6" from amp or DI box | Often blend mic + DI signal for clarity and punch. DI for definition, mic for tone |
| **Acoustic Guitar** | Small diaphragm condenser (AKG C451) / Cardioid | 6-12" pointed at 12th fret | Further back for more room sound, closer for detail and isolation |
| **Drum Overheads** | Small diaphragm condensers or ribbon mics / Cardioid or Figure-8 | 3-4 feet above kit, spaced pair or X/Y | Captures cymbals and overall kit balance. Experiment with height and width |
| **Snare** | SM57 (top) + SM57/condenser (bottom) / Cardioid | 1-2" from rim, angled toward center. Bottom mic underneath | Check phase between top and bottom mics. Flip phase on one if sounds thin |
| **Toms** | Sennheiser MD 421 or SM57 / Cardioid | 1-2" from rim, angled toward center | One mic per tom for isolation. Gate to reduce spill from other drums |
| **Kick Drum** | AKG D112, Beta 52, or RE20 / Cardioid | Inside drum or at port hole, 2-6" from beater | Inside for more attack/click, port hole for more tone and fullness |
| **Cello** | Large diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 1-2 feet away, aimed at f-holes or bridge | Further back captures more room tone, closer is more focused |
| **Violin** | Small diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 1-2 feet above and in front, angled downward | Avoid too close - causes harsh, scratchy sound |
| **Double Bass** | Large diaphragm condenser or DI/pickup / Cardioid | 6-12" from f-hole or bridge area | Can blend mic and DI/pickup signals for best of both worlds |
| **Brass (Trumpet/Trombone)** | Dynamic (SM57) or condenser / Cardioid | 6-12" from bell, slightly off-axis | Further for ensemble, closer for solo. Off-axis reduces harshness |
| **Flute/Clarinet** | Small diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 6-12" from keys/holes | Avoid aiming directly at mouthpiece - reduces breath and key noise |
| **Saxophone** | Dynamic or condenser / Cardioid | 6-12" from bell or above keys | Above keys captures full range nicely, bell gives more focused tone |
| **Vocals** | Large diaphragm condenser (Neumann U87, AKG C414) / Cardioid | 6-12" with pop shield | Pop shield reduces plosives. SM58 dynamic for live performances |
| **Backing Vocals** | Condenser or dynamic / Cardioid | 6-12" with pop shield | Can use one mic for multiple singers if grouped well around mic |
| **Congas** | Dynamic (SM57) or small diaphragm condenser / Cardioid | 2-6" above rim, angled toward center | One mic per drum for isolation, or overhead pair for multiple congas |
| **Xylophones/Vibes** | Small diaphragm condenser pair / Cardioid | 1-2 feet above, spaced pair or X/Y | Stereo pair captures full width of instrument. Experiment with spacing |

### Advanced Micing Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Spaced/AB Pair** | Two mics (omni/cardioid) placed 3-10 feet apart pointing at source. Captures wide, natural stereo image but can have phase issues. Good for orchestras. |
| **X/Y or coincident pair** | Two cardioid mics at 90° angle with capsules as close as possible. Mono-compatible stereo with good imaging. No phase problems. |
| **M/S (mid side)** | One cardioid (mid) pointing at source, one figure-8 (side) perpendicular at 90°. Allows adjustment of stereo width in post-production. Excellent mono compatibility. |

### How Mics Actually Work

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Electro-magnetic induction** | In dynamic mics: Moving a conductor (diaphragm attached to coil) through magnetic field creates electrical current proportional to diaphragm movement. |
| **Front/back plate** | In condenser mics: front plate (diaphragm) moves with sound waves, back plate is fixed. Changing distance creates variable capacitance which generates electrical signal. |
| **Transducer** | Device that converts one form of energy to another. Microphones convert acoustic energy (sound pressure waves) to electrical energy (voltage). |
| **Diaphragm/membrane** | Thin material (plastic, metal) that vibrates sympathetically with sound waves. Its movement is converted to electrical signal by mic mechanism. |
