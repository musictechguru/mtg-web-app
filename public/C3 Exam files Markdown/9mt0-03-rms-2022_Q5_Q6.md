#### Indicative Content Guidance

The indicative content below is not prescriptive and candidates are not required to include all of it. Other relevant material not suggested below must also be credited. Relevant points may include the following.

**For lines in italics, don't credit twice (including opposites)**

##### AO3 - Song Specific

**Reverb Characteristics:**

- Resonant/mid-heavy/modulated guitar reverbs (at start/end)
- Reverb levels vary dramatically

**Reverb Usage in Different Sections:**
- In loud parts of the song (1:39-2:50 and 3:45 onwards) rhythm guitar and vocals have short/moderate reverb
- Fairly low send level
- Prominent early reflections
- E.g. plate/spring/room

**Drums:**
- Natural/room/plate reverb on drums
- Short/medium reverb time
- Short pre-delay
- Strong early reflections
