## Question 5: Van Halen: Jump (1984) and Paul Anka: Jump (2005)

**Total Marks: 15 (AO3: 5 marks / AO4: 10 marks)**

**TYPE 1**

### Marking Instructions

Markers must apply the descriptors in line with the general marking guidance and the qualities outlined in the levels-based mark scheme below. 

**Responses that demonstrate only AO3 without any AO4 should be awarded marks as follows:**
- Level 1 AO3 performance: 1 mark
- Level 2 AO3 performance: 2 marks
- Level 3 AO3 performance: 3 marks
- Level 4 AO3 performance: 4 marks
- Level 5 AO3 performance: 5 marks

### Indicative Content Guidance

The indicative content below is not prescriptive and candidates are not required to include all of it. Other relevant material not suggested below must also be credited.

### Level-Based Mark Scheme

| Level | Mark | Descriptor |
|-------|------|------------|
| **0** | 0 | No rewardable material |
| **Level 1** | 1-3 | • Demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding of production techniques used, some of which may be inaccurate or irrelevant (AO3)<br>• Gives limited analysis and deconstruction of production techniques used with little attempt at chains of reasoning (AO4)<br>• Makes limited comparisons between the two recordings, with little or no conclusion (AO4) |
| **Level 2** | 4-6 | • Demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of production techniques used, which is occasionally relevant but may include some inaccuracies (AO3)<br>• Gives some analysis and deconstruction of production techniques used with simplistic chains of reasoning (AO4)<br>• Makes some comparisons between the two recordings, reaching unsupported conclusions (AO4) |
| **Level 3** | 7-9 | • Demonstrates clear knowledge and understanding of production techniques used, which is mostly relevant and accurate (AO3)<br>• Gives clear analysis and deconstruction of production techniques used, with competent chains of reasoning (AO4)<br>• Makes clear comparisons between the two recordings, reaching partially supported conclusions (AO4) |
| **Level 4** | 10-12 | • Demonstrates detailed knowledge and understanding of production techniques used, which is relevant and accurate (AO3)<br>• Gives detailed and accurate analysis and deconstruction of production techniques used, with logical chains of reasoning on occasion (AO4)<br>• Makes detailed comparisons between the two recordings, reaching well supported conclusions (AO4) |
| **Level 5** | 13-15 | • Demonstrates sophisticated and accurate knowledge of production techniques used throughout (AO3)<br>• Gives sophisticated and accurate analysis and deconstruction of production techniques used, with logical chains of reasoning throughout (AO4)<br>• Makes detailed comparisons between the two recordings, reaching sophisticated conclusions (AO4) |

### Level-Based Mark Scheme

| Level | Mark | Descriptor |
|-------|------|------------|
| **0** | 0 | No rewardable material |
| **Level 1** | 1-4 | • Demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding of production techniques/technology used, some of which may be inaccurate or irrelevant (AO3)<br>• Applies limited analysis and deconstruction of production techniques/technology used in the recording with little attempt at chains of reasoning (AO4)<br>• Makes limited connections between the production techniques/technology used in the recording and their wider impact (AO4)<br>• Makes limited evaluative and/or critical judgements about the wider impact of the production techniques/technology used in the recording (AO4) |
| **Level 2** | 5-8 | • Demonstrates knowledge and understanding of production techniques/technology used, which are occasionally relevant but may include some inaccuracies (AO3)<br>• Applies some analysis and deconstruction of production techniques/technology used in the recording, with simplistic chains of reasoning (AO4)<br>• Makes some connections between the production techniques/technology used in the recording and their wider impact (AO4)<br>• Makes some evaluative and/or critical judgements about the wider impact of the production techniques/technology used in the recording (AO4) |
| **Level 3** | 9-12 | • Demonstrates clear knowledge and understanding of production techniques/technology used, which are mostly relevant and accurate (AO3)<br>• Applies clear analysis and deconstruction of production techniques/technology used in the recording which is mostly detailed, with competent chains of reasoning (AO4)<br>• Makes valid connections between the production techniques/technology used in the recording and their wider impact (AO4)<br>• Makes clear evaluative and critical judgements about the wider impact of the production techniques/technology used in the recording (AO4) |
| **Level 4** | 13-16 | • Demonstrates detailed knowledge and understanding of production techniques/technology used, which are relevant and accurate (AO3)<br>• Applies detailed and accurate analysis and deconstruction of production techniques/technology used in the recording, with logical chains of reasoning on occasion (AO4)<br>• Makes detailed and valid connections between the production techniques/technology used in the recording and their wider impact (AO4)<br>• Makes detailed and valid evaluative and critical judgements about the wider impact of the production techniques/technology used in the recording (AO4) |
| **Level 5** | 17-20 | • Demonstrates sophisticated and accurate knowledge and understanding of production techniques/technology used throughout (AO3)<br>• Applies sophisticated and accurate analysis and deconstruction of production techniques/technology used in the recording and logical chains of reasoning throughout (AO4)<br>• Makes sophisticated and valid connections between the production techniques/technology used in the recording and their wider impact (AO4)<br>• Makes sophisticated and valid evaluative and critical judgements about the wider impact of the production techniques/technology used in the recording (AO4) |
