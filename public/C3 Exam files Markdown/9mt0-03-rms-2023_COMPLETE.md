# Music Technology Component 3 Mark Scheme
## Summer 2023

### Paper: 9MT0/03

## General Marking Guidance

- All candidates must receive the same treatment. Examiners must mark the first candidate in exactly the same way as they mark the last.
- Mark schemes should be applied positively. Candidates must be rewarded for what they have shown they can do rather than penalised for omissions.
- Examiners should mark according to the mark scheme not according to their perception of where the grade boundaries may lie.
- There is no ceiling on achievement. All marks on the mark scheme should be used appropriately.
- All the marks on the mark scheme are designed to be awarded. Examiners should always award full marks if deserved, i.e. if the answer matches the mark scheme. Examiners should also be prepared to award zero marks if the candidate's response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme.
- Where some judgement is required, mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded and exemplification may be limited.
- When examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a candidate's response, the team leader must be consulted.
- Crossed out work should be marked UNLESS the candidate has replaced it with an alternative response.

#### AO4 - Impact of the Technology

**Don't credit points in italics where they have already been awarded in song specific detail**

General Lo-Fi/Retro Concepts:
- Distortion/degradation of signal is normally avoided
- Lo-fi refers to deliberately degrading an audio signal
- Simulates old recording media/analogue technology
- May use (emulations of) old equipment/recording techniques
- Gives contrast with hi-fi parts of a production/between sections
- Nostalgic/a tribute to earlier, influential artists
- Reaction to sterile/clinical digital production
- DJ scratching/re-recording music to vinyl
- Unwanted noise difficult to avoid in earlier recordings

Early Distortion Techniques:
- Guitar/organ distortion one of the first deliberate ways to degrade an audio signal
- Gritty/harsh/adds power/adds sustain
- Adds harmonics
- Psychedelic music uses lo-fi techniques

Tape-Based Techniques:
- Tape delay - pleasing distortion/pitch modulation/filtering
- Passing sounds through mechanical processors
- Rotary/Leslie cabinet for swirling, distorted sounds
- Restricting frequency response
- Spring reverb for mid-range, twangy reverb/thunder-like effects when banged
- Tape wear/stretching/wow and flutter
- Tape/analogue/vinyl warmth
- Recording tracks to tape for saturation
- Tape emulation plug-ins

Sampling and Found Sound:
- Found sound/clips from TV and radio interviews used in experimental music
- Found sound creates ambience/atmosphere
- Punk music production welcomes noise/distortion
- Rap samples have noise intentionally left in
- Taking samples from old/noisy recordings

Digital Lo-Fi Techniques:
- Over-compression
- DAW technology made retro production easier to do
- Distortion/telephone effect on vocals
- Fuzz/parallel processing on bass
- Digital distortion/bit-crushing (e.g. on drums)
- Selecting older samplers with bit-depth and sample rate limitations
- Stuttering/imperfections in loops

Retro Equipment and Techniques:
- Contemporary producers seek a retro feel by using vintage tube technology
- Ribbon microphones for duller/mid-heavy sounds
- Producers simulate limitations in recording and mixing
- Unusual/polarised panning
- Ambient capture of drums
- Recreating 1980s techniques e.g. FM synthesis, over-use of short samples, tightly quantised drum machine lines and heavy (digital) reverb
- Emulating vinyl crackle
- Analogue synth tuning problems
- Saturation/tube plug-ins
- Adds harmonics/thickens the sound
- Using convolution to model retro hardware
- Analogue summing of stems/mixing and mastering using analogue outboard
