- B) Using multiple compressors in series, each doing gentle compression - more transparent than one heavy compressor
- C) Only one compressor allowed
- D) Serial compression doesn't exist

**Answer: B**

### Question 5
A famous vocal chain uses an 1176 followed by an LA-2A. Why use two compressors?
- A) One compressor is broken
- B) 1176 catches fast peaks, LA-2A smooths overall - each does part of the job
- C) Serial compression doesn't work
- D) Only one should be used

**Answer: B**

### Question 6
What's "sidechain compression"?
- A) Compression on the sides of the stereo field
- B) One sound triggers compression on another sound
- C) A broken compressor
- D) Sidechain is not real

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Sidechaining uses an external signal (like a kick drum) to trigger compression on another track (like bass).

### Question 7
In electronic dance music, the bass "ducks" every time the kick hits. What technique creates this?
- A) Volume automation only
- B) Sidechain compression - kick drum signal controls compressor on bass, ducking it rhythmically
- C) EQ
- D) Ducking is not possible

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Sidechaining uses an external signal (like a kick drum) to trigger compression on another track (like bass).

### Question 8
You want a vocal to automatically reduce the music volume when singing. What technique does this?
- A) Manual fader riding only
- B) Sidechain compression - vocal triggers compressor on music bus, ducking music when vocal is present
- C) EQ on vocals
- D) This effect is impossible

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Sidechaining uses an external signal (like a kick drum) to trigger compression on another track (like bass).

### Question 9
In serial compression, each compressor should typically reduce gain by how much?
- A) 20dB each
- B) 3-4dB each
- C) No gain reduction
- D) 50dB each

**Answer: B**

### Question 10
You blend 80% dry drum signal with 20% heavily compressed drum signal. What's the benefit over 100% compressed?
- A) No benefit
- B) Preserves natural transients and dynamics while adding thickness and sustain - best of both worlds
- C) Dry signal should never be used
- D) Parallel mixing makes things worse

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Threshold is the level setting at which distinct dynamic processing (compression, gating) begins.
