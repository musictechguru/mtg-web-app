- B) Common-mode rejection cancels interference; signals on pins 2 and 3 are out of phase, noise is in phase and canceled
- C) They sound louder
- D) No difference

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** XLR is a balanced 3-pin connector standard for microphones and professional audio gear.

### Question 5
A shock mount uses elastic suspension. What types of unwanted sounds does this reduce?
- A) High-frequency feedback
- B) Low-frequency rumble, floor vibrations, handling noise, stand bumps
- C) Vocal plosives
- D) Room reverb

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** ratio determines the intensity of the gain reduction once the signal passes the threshold.

### Question 10
What advantage does a high-quality cable with better shielding provide?
- A) Louder sound
- B) Better rejection of RF interference, electromagnetic interference, and noise
- C) Changes the polar pattern
- D) No advantage; all cables are identical

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Phase interference occurs when waves interact, either boosting (constructive) or cutting (destructive) the sound.
