# SUBJECT 1: AUDIO FUNDAMENTALS (10 Questions)

### Question 1
What is audio?
- A) Only electricity
- B) Only light
- C) Vibrations traveling through air
- D) Only silence

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Audio vs Sound: Think of a live vocalist. Their voice is 'Sound' (air pressure). The signal flowing through the XLR cable to the mixer is 'Audio' (electricity).

**Expert Quote:** "We take these sound waves, this sound, and we organize it into emotion, and that's how we connect with our audiences. - Stefon Harris"
























---

### Question 2
Frequency is measured in:
- A) Decibels
- B) Hertz
- C) Volts
- D) Watts

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Hertz (Hz): Imagine a drummer hitting 100 beats per second—that would be a low hum at 100Hz. Frequency is just the speed of vibration.

**Expert Quote:** "Just trust your ears. You can hear as well as anyone else what sounds good and what doesn't. - Tape Op Magazine"
























---

### Question 3
What determines the pitch of a sound?
- A) Volume
- B) Color
- C) Frequency
- D) Length

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Pitch is perception. A 440Hz vibration is physics; we hear it as the musical note 'A4' (Middle A), the standard tuning reference for orchestras.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/pitch_vs_frequency.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "Sound is physical; audio is electrical. Know the difference. - Engineering 101"
























---

### Question 4
Amplitude determines:
- A) Color
- B) Loudness/volume of sound
- C) Pitch
- D) Speed

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Amplitude is energy. Plucking a guitar string harder creates a larger physical vibration (amplitude), which we hear as a louder volume.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/amplitude_loudness.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "We don’t capture sound; we capture a representation of it. - Philosophy of Audio"
























---

### Question 5
Human hearing range is approximately:
- A) 1Hz to 10Hz
- B) 100Hz to 1kHz
- C) 20Hz to 20kHz
- D) 50kHz to 100kHz

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** 20Hz-20kHz: From the lowest sub-bass rumble of an 808 kick (30-60Hz) to the highest air of a vocal reverb (15kHz+), this is our musical canvas.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/diagram_fletcher_munson_v2.png)

---

### Question 6
A waveform shows:
- A) Only color
- B) Visual representation of sound over time
- C) No information
- D) Only temperature

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Waveform: The visual 'shape' of sound. A smooth curve is a flute; a jagged, spiky line is a distorted guitar. We edit audio by looking at these shapes.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/waveform_time_domain.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "Trust your ears, but check your meters. Ears can be fooled; meters don’t lie... mostly. - Studio Wisdom"
























---

### Question 7
The unit for measuring sound pressure level is:
- A) Hertz
- B) Decibels
- C) Volts
- D) Meters

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Decibels (dB): Our ears are logarithmic. To make a sound feel 'twice as loud', we need 10 times the power. That's why a 100W amp isn't 10x louder than a 10W amp.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/dbfs_meter.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "Audio is the art of preserving an emotional moment in time. - Producer"
























---

### Question 8
What is a transient?
- A) Sustained tone
- B) Short, sharp sound
- C) Silence

**Expert Quote:** "If it sounds good, it is good. But 'why' it sounds good is physics. - Joe Meek Rule"
























---

### Question 9
Bass frequencies are:
- A) Very high pitch
- B) Low frequencies
- C) Only silence
- D) Above 20kHz

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Bass (20-250Hz): The foundation. In a club, this is the frequency range that physically moves your chest. Without it, music feels thin and weak.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/frequency_spectrum_bass.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration. - Nikola Tesla"
























---

### Question 10
Treble frequencies are:
- A) Low frequencies
- B) Mid frequencies
- C) High frequencies
- D) Below 20Hz

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Treble (4kHz+): The detail. This is where the 'air' lives. It defines the expensive sheen of a pop vocal or the shimmer of a cymbal.

**Expert Quote:** "The decibel is relative. Always ask: 'Relative to what?' - Metering Pro"
























---

### Question 4
What is clipping?
- A) Good sound quality
- B) Distortion from signal too loud
- C) Perfect recording
- D) Very quiet sound

**Answer: B**

**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/dbfs_meter.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "Silence is the canvas. Noise is the texture. - Ambient Composer"
























---

### Question 6
Dynamic range is:
- A) Only loud sounds
- B) Only quiet sounds
- C) Difference between quietest and loudest
- D) No variation

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Headroom: The safety zone. If you record at -12dB, you leave room for the drummer to get excited and hit louder without ruining the take.
**Image:** !["Diagram"](/images/svg/headroom_diagram.svg)
**Expert Quote:** "Dynamic range is the distance between the noise floor and the distortion point. - Technical Definition"
























---

### Question 4
Red clip indicators mean:
- A) Perfect level
- B) Reduce gain immediately
- C) Increase gain
- D) No action needed

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Soft Clip: A feature on some limiters that rounds off the corners of the wave instead of chopping them flat. Sounds warmer and less harsh.

### Question 5
Leaving 6dB headroom means peaks are at:
- A) 0dBFS
- B) -6dBFS
- C) +6dBFS
- D) -50dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Master Bus Creep: You push the drum fader, then the bass, then the vocal. Suddenly the master is clipping. Turn everything DOWN instead.

### Question 6
Why leave headroom?
- A) No reason
- B) Makes sound worse
- C) Safety for unexpected peaks
- D) Wastes space

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Visual Waveform: If your recorded waveform looks like a solid block with flat tops, it is clipped. You cannot fix this. Re-record it.

### Question 7
Recording at -18dBFS average provides:
- A) No headroom
- B) Adequate headroom and safety
- C) Too much distortion
- D) Clipping

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Bit Depth Safety: 24-bit recording gives you a massive noise floor safety net. You can record quietly to avoid clipping and turn it up later safely.

### Question 8
If you see red clipping lights:
- A) Increase gain more
- B) Do nothing
- C) Reduce preamp gain
- D) It's perfect

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Limiter on Output: A safety belt. Always have a limiter set to -0.1dB on your output when bouncing files to ensure no stray peaks ruin the file.

### Question 9
Dynamic sources (like drums) need:
- A) No headroom
- B) More headroom for peaks
- C) Less headroom
- D) Maximum levels always

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Gain Staging Rules: Don't boost EQ by +12dB. That eats headroom. Cut the frequencies you don't want instead.

### Question 10
The professional rule is:
- A) Always clip
- B) Record as hot as possible
- C) You can add level later, can't un-clip
- D) Headroom doesn't matter

**Answer: C**

**Expert Explanation:** Perceived Loudness: Don't clip the master to make it loud. Use compression and saturation to increase density/RMS level instead.
