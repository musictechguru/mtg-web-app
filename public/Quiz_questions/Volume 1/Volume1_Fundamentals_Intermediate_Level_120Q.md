# SUBJECT 12: PREVENTING CLIPPING & HEADROOM (10 Questions)

### Question 1
Recording at -10dBFS peaks provides how much headroom?
- A) 0dB
- B) 10dB
- C) -10dB
- D) 20dB

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Intersample Peaks: The hidden clip. Digital samples might be below 0dB, but the analog curve between them arcs over. True Peak meters reveal this.

**Expert Quote:** "Pay attention to the details here; they make the difference. - Study Guide"















---

### Question 2
Your average level is -18dBFS, crest factor is 10dB. Peaks are:
- A) -28dBFS
- B) -8dBFS
- C) -18dBFS
- D) 0dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Floating Point: 32-bit float allows values above 0dBFS internally. You can recover a clipped channel by just turning the fader down. Magic.

---

### Question 3
What is the peak level if RMS is -20dBFS and crest factor is 14dB?
- A) -34dBFS
- B) -6dBFS
- C) -20dBFS
- D) 0dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Loudness War: The historic trend of crushing dynamic range to -6 LUFS. Luckily, streaming normalization (Spotify -14 LUFS) has ended this.

### Question 4
Signal peaks at -3dBFS. Headroom is:
- A) 0dB
- B) 3dB
- C) -3dB
- D) 6dB

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Brickwall vs Clipping: A limiter cleanly reduces gain. A clipper intentionally chops the wave. Some mastering engineers use clippers for 'transparent' loudness.

---

### Question 5
To avoid clipping, peaks should stay below:
- A) -50dBFS
- B) 0dBFS
- C) +6dBFS
- D) -100dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Crest Factor: The difference between Peak and RMS. A high crest factor sound (snare) needs headroom. A low crest factor sound (distorted bass) does not.

---

### Question 6
Reducing level by 6dB changes -4dBFS to:
- A) -2dBFS
- B) -10dBFS
- C) +2dBFS
- D) 0dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** D/A Converter Overload: Even if the file isn't clipped, a signal hitting 0dBFS can overload the analog circuitry of a cheap DAC. Leave -1dB margin.

---

### Question 7
Digital 0dBFS equals what in terms of clipping?
- A) Perfect level
- B) Maximum before distortion
- C) Minimum level
- D) -6dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Digital Overs: A 'Clip' isn't just one sample. Most meters light up after 3 consecutive samples at 0dBFS. That's an audible glitch.

**Expert Quote:** "Every great producer understands these fundamentals. - Industry Standard"















---

### Question 8
Recording with 12dB headroom means peaks at:
- A) 0dBFS
- B) -12dBFS
- C) +12dBFS
- D) -6dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Gain Interdependence: EQ affects headroom. A Low Cut filter can actually INCREASE peak levels due to phase shift! Watch your meters.

---

### Question 9
If input clips at interface and you reduce preamp gain, clipping:
- A) Stays
- B) Fixed
- C) Gets worse
- D) No effect

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Restoration: Tools like iZotope RX can 'de-clip' by mathematically guessing what the waveform looked like. It works surprisingly well on mild clips.

### Question 10
Conservative recording level targets peaks around:
- A) 0dBFS
- B) -12dBFS to -6dBFS
- C) -50dBFS
- D) +6dBFS

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Delivery Specs: Broadcast TV has strict limits (e.g., -23 LUFS, -1dBTP). Failing these automated checks means your mix gets rejected instantly.
