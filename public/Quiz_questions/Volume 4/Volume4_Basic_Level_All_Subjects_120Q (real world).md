### Question 10
You move a knob on your MIDI controller to adjust filter cutoff in real-time. This type of control is the main purpose of MIDI CC (Controller Change) messages. True or false?
- A) False - CC doesn't control parameters
- B) True - CC messages allow real-time control of various synthesizer parameters beyond just notes
- C) CC only controls volume
- D) CC messages don't exist

**Answer: B**

**Expert Explanation:** Filters remove specific frequencies from the spectrum.
