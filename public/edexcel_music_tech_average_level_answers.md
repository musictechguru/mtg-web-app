## Teaching Points: Moving from Average to Level 5

**To improve from average level, students should:**

1. **Learn specific equipment models:**
   - Not "tape machine" → Studer A80, Ampex 350
   - Not "compressor" → SSL bus compressor, LA-2A, dbx 160

2. **Include precise parameters:**
   - Not "lots of bass" → +6dB at 60Hz
   - Not "fast attack" → 5ms attack time
   - Not "long reverb" → 4.2s decay time

3. **Use accurate technical terminology:**
   - Not "makes it louder" → gain reduction, threshold, ratio
   - Not "swirling effect" → Leslie rotating speaker, 357 RPM
   - Not "echo effect" → slap-back delay, 190ms

4. **Add specific contextual details:**
   - Not "the 1960s" → "1966, following 4-track adoption in 1964"
   - Not "became popular" → "used on 40% of Billboard hits 1982-1985"
   - Not "influenced music" → "directly influenced Radiohead's OK Computer production"

5. **Explain cause and effect:**
   - Not "they used compression" → "VCA compression with 4:1 ratio and 20ms attack preserved transients while controlling dynamics"
   - Not "stereo was used" → "Hard L/R panning from 4-track limitations requiring mono compatibility checking"

6. **Provide technical justification:**
   - Not "sounds good" → "creates pumping effect via -12dB gain reduction on kick hits"
   - Not "makes it interesting" → "filter sweep from 200Hz to 20kHz over 22 seconds builds tension before drop"
