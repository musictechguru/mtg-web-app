## Common Characteristics of Below Average Answers

### Typical Weaknesses

**1. Vague, non-technical language:**
- "sounds good," "sounds weird," "sounds different"
- "special effects," "lots of equipment," "better technology"
- "professional," "modern," "clean production"

**2. Descriptive rather than analytical:**
- Describes what they hear, not how it was made
- "The drums sound loud" vs "Drums compressed with 4:1 ratio"
- "Voice sounds different" vs "Leslie speaker creating rotary effect"

**3. Confusion of concepts:**
- Visual/audio confusion ("black and white recording")
- Era stereotypes ("sounds very 1980s") without explaining why
- Genre labels without technical understanding

**4. Factual errors or misconceptions:**
- Incorrect attribution of techniques
- Misunderstanding of technology timelines
- Confusion between recording and mixing processes

**5. Minimal contextual knowledge:**
- General historical facts without production context
- "Technology improved" without explaining how
- Generic statements about popularity or influence

**6. No technical terminology:**
- Missing: compression, EQ frequencies, delay times, panning percentages
- Missing: equipment models, studio names, specific innovations
- Missing: parameters, ratios, settings

**7. Superficial observations:**
- States obvious elements ("drums keep the beat")
- No analysis of technique choices or their effects
- Lists instruments without explaining processing

**Average (7-11 marks):**
"Echo effect on the vocals created using a second tape machine, became popular technique, Sam Phillips invented it"

**Below Average (1-6 marks):**
"There was echo on the voice, reverb was added to make it sound bigger"

### 1980s Michael Jackson Example - "Bass Processing"

**Level 5 (13-15 marks):**
"Bass through SSL bus compressor with sidechain triggered from kick, -12dB gain reduction on kick hits, 50ms attack, 200ms release, creating pumping effect"

**Average (7-11 marks):**
"The bass guitar had compression that pumped with the kick drum"

**Below Average (1-6 marks):**
"The bass line is very catchy, bass guitar is played throughout"

### 1990s Dr. Dre Example - "Sampling"

## Teaching Strategies to Improve from Below Average

**For students scoring 1-6 marks, focus on:**

1. **Learn to distinguish description from analysis:**
   - Practice: Take one song, list what you hear (description), then research HOW it was made (analysis)

2. **Build basic technical vocabulary:**
   - Start with: compression, EQ, reverb, delay, panning
   - Add units: dB, Hz, ms, seconds, ratio

3. **Use specific numbers:**
   - Not "lots" → Research actual measurements
   - Not "loud" → Find actual dB levels
   - Not "long" → Find actual time durations

4. **Name equipment:**
   - Research what equipment was used on famous songs
   - Learn 3-5 key pieces per decade

5. **Explain cause and effect:**
   - Template: "[Technique] with [parameters] creates [sonic result] because [reason]"
   - Example: "Sidechain compression with -12dB reduction creates pumping because bass ducks when kick hits"

6. **Connect production to context:**
   - Not just "what" but "why" - why was this technique used?
   - Consider technological limitations and artistic choices

7. **Stop using vague adjectives:**
   - Replace "good/bad/weird/different" with technical descriptions
   - Focus on: frequency ranges, dynamic ranges, stereo placement, temporal effects
