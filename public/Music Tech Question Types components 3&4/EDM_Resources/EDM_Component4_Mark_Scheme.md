*   **Ratio:** High ratio (4:1 - 10:1 or higher) for noticeable "pumping" effect.
*   **Threshold:** Lower until gain reduction meter shows significant ducking (-10dB to -30dB).
**Award 1 mark for each valid point (Setup, Attack, Release, Pumping description), maximum 4.**
*Must reference "Kick" triggering the compressor.*

**Award 1 mark.**

**Part (b) (2 marks)**
*   **Ratio:** 4:1 to 8:1
*   **Attack:** Slow / Medium (10ms - 30ms) to let the transient punch through before compression clamps down.

---

**Question 9: Pad Layering (2 marks)**

**Acceptable answers:**
*   **Filter Type:** High Pass Filter (HPF)
*   **Frequency:** 200Hz - 500Hz (to remove mud) OR Low Pass Filter at 2kHz - 5kHz (to sit behind leads).
*   **Context:** Specifically looking for filtering that creates space. "Not clashing with brightness" implies LPF to roll off highs OR HPF to clear mids.
**Award 1 mark for Filter Type + 1 mark for justifiable Frequency.**

# SECTION B (30 Marks)

**Question 11: Production Planning (10 marks)**

| Level | Mark | Descriptor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 4** | **9-10** | **Comprehensive** technical knowledge (AO3) of synthesis (Supersaw stacks, Sine Sub) and drum sequencing. **Sophisticated** understanding (AO4) of arrangement workflow (Energy build, Drop impact). Detailed justification of sound choices. EDM terminology used professionally throughout. |
| **Level 3** | **7-8** | **Good** technical knowledge. Describes layering correctly. Good understanding of arrangement structure (Intro -> Build -> Drop). Most decisions justified. Minor omissions in detail. |
| **Level 2** | **4-6** | **Some** technical knowledge. Mentions basic synthesis but lacks detail (e.g., "use a synth"). Basic understanding of arrangement. Limited justification. |
| **Level 1** | **1-3** | **Limited** knowledge. Vague description of process. Genre conventions not clearly understood. |

**Key Points to Credit:**
*   **Sound Selection:** Correctly identifying Saw waves for leads, Sine for sub. Layering strategy (Noise, Click).
*   **Sequencing:** 4/4 Kick pattern. Off-beat Bass (optional). 16-bar phrasing. Velocity variation on hi-hats for groove.
*   **Techniques:** Risers (White noise), Downlifters, Filter Sweeps, Sidechain pumping, Reverb throws.

**Question 12: Mixing Strategy (10 marks)**

| Level | Mark | Descriptor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 4** | **9-10** | **Comprehensive** strategy. Specific frequency ranges cited for EQ (e.g., "Cut 300Hz mud"). Specific compression settings (Rationales given). detailed Sidechain explanation. Sophisticated spatial placement (Mid/Side, Mono subs). |
| **Level 3** | **7-8** | **Good** strategy. Correct general frequency areas (Lows, Mids, Highs). Describes sidechain correctly. Good spatial awareness. Justified mixing decisions. |
| **Level 2** | **4-6** | **Some** strategy. Basic EQ ("boost bass"). Mentions compression but vague on parameters. Basic panning. |
| **Level 1** | **1-3** | **Limited** strategy. Incorrect or missing technical values. Little understanding of genre mixing requirements. |

**Key Points to Credit:**
*   **EQ:** Kick/Bass separation (Kick @ 60Hz, Bass @ 40Hz or vice versa). Scooping low-mids (200-500Hz). Boosting Air (8kHz+) on leads.
*   **Compression:** Sidechain is essential for "pumping". Bus compression for "glue".
*   **Space:** Mono Sub/Kick. Wide Leads/Pads/FX. Reverb on sends to control mix clarity.

**Question 13: Supersaw Sound Design (10 marks)**

| Level | Mark | Descriptor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 4** | **9-10** | **Precise** recipe. Specifies 7-9 voices, detune cents (15-30), multiple octaves. Correct LPF/BPF filter usage with envelope. Detailed FX chain (Hyper/Dimension -> EQ -> Delay -> Reverb -> Compression). |
| **Level 3** | **7-8** | **Good** recipe. Identifies Saw waves + Unison/Detune. Basic filter settings. Valid FX chain. Lacks some fine parameter detail. |
| **Level 2** | **4-6** | **Basic** recipe. "Use saw waves". Mentions detuning vaguely. Basic effects listed. |
| **Level 1** | **1-3** | **Limited** recipe. Wrong waveform or synthesis method. Missing essential components (Unison,Detune). |

**Key Points to Credit:**
*   **Oscillators:** Sawtooth. Unison enabled. High voice count. Detune spread.

*   **FX:** OTT / Multiband Compression (Essential for EDM sound). Reverb (Large). Delay (Ping-pong). Saturation.
