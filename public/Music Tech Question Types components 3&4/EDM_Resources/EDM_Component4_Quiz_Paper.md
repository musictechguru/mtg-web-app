# SECTION A (30 Marks)

**1. Supersaw Lead Synthesis**
A supersaw lead in your EDM track sounds thin and lacks stereo width.
(a) State **two** synthesis parameters you would adjust to increase the width and thickness of the sound. (2)
(b) Name **one** effect plugin/processor you would apply to further enhance the width, and specify **one** parameter setting for that effect. (2)

**2. Sidechain Compression Setup**
Describe the process of setting up sidechain compression on a bass synth triggered by the kick drum to create a "pumping" effect. Include appropriate **Attack** and **Release** time settings in your answer. (4)

**3. Kick Drum Mixing**
State **three** specific frequency ranges you would boost or cut when mixing an EDM kick drum to achieve punch, clarity, and sub-bass power. For each range, specify whether you would **boost** or **cut**. (3)

**4. White Noise Riser**
You are creating a white noise "riser" fx for a build-up.
(a) Which **filter type** would you automate? (1)
(b) Describe the automation curve you would draw for the **Cutoff Frequency** over an 8-bar build-up. (2)

**5. Pluck Synth Design**
You want to create a classic EDM "pluck" sound using a synthesizer.
(a) Which **envelope** (Amp or Filter) is most critical for this sound? (1)
(b) Describe the **Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release (ADSR)** settings required to achieve the plucking character. (2)

**6. Reverb & Space**
(a) Explain why "Pre-delay" is important when applying reverb to a main EDM lead vocal. (1)
(b) Recommend a **Reverb Time (Decay)** value range (in seconds or ms) suitable for a large "Big Room" EDM lead sound. (1)

**7. Sub-Bass Management**
(a) Why is it common practice to keep sub-bass frequencies (below 120Hz) in **mono**? (1)
(b) Which oscillator waveform is most commonly used for the fundamental sub-bass layer? (1)

**8. Snare Drum Processing**
Your snare drum is getting lost in the mix during the drop.
(a) Which frequency range (in Hz/kHz) creates the main "crack" or "snap" of the snare? (1)
(b) Suggest a **Compression Ratio** and **Attack Time** setting to emphasize the transient punch of the snare. (2)

**9. Pad Layering**
You are layering a "warm" analog pad under your bright supersaw chords.
(a) Which **filter type** and **cutoff frequency** range would you use on the pad to ensure it doesn't clash with the brightness of the leads? (2)

**10. Loudness & Mastering**
(a) What is the typical target **Integrated Loudness (LUFS)** for a commercial EDM track? (1)
(b) Which processor is placed at the very end of the mastering chain to prevent clipping while maximizing volume? (1)
(c) What "Ceiling" or "Output Level" setting (in dBTP) is recommended for streaming services? (1)

# SECTION B (30 Marks)

**Question 11: Production Planning for EDM Track (10 marks)**

You are producing a progressive house EDM track (128 BPM) that features:
*   A supersaw lead line
*   Sub-bass foundation
*   Four-to-the-floor kick drum pattern
*   Rolling hi-hats
*   Atmospheric pads
*   Vocal chops

Describe your production approach from initial planning through to arrangement, including:

(a) **Pre-production planning:** Sound selection strategy and synthesis approach for the lead and bass sounds. (4)
(b) **Sequencing workflow:** How you would program the drums and arrange the track structure (intro, build, drop, breakdown). (3)
(c) **Key EDM-specific production techniques** you would employ to create energy and impact. (3)

*Your response should demonstrate knowledge of EDM production conventions and explain your technical decisions.*

**Question 12: Mixing Strategy for EDM Elements (10 marks)**

You have completed production on an EDM track with the following elements:
*   Kick drum (layered: sub + punch + click)
*   Sub-bass (sine wave bass following kick pattern)
*   Supersaw lead synth
*   Pluck synth (melodic pattern)
*   Atmospheric pad
*   Hi-hats (open and closed patterns)
*   Snare/clap
*   Vocal chops

Describe your mixing strategy to achieve a powerful, club-ready EDM mix, including:

(a) **EQ approach** for kick, bass, and lead elements, referencing specific frequency ranges. (4)
(b) **Compression techniques** including sidechain compression application. (3)
(c) **Spatial placement** (panning and stereo width) and effects processing (reverb, delay). (3)

*Your response should include specific parameter values and explain how you achieve the characteristic EDM "pumping" effect and loudness.*

**Question 13: Supersaw Lead Sound Design (10 marks)**

Create a detailed sound design recipe for a massive EDM supersaw lead sound suitable for the main drop of a progressive house track.

Your recipe must include:

(a) **Synthesis method and oscillator configuration** (detune amount, octaves, waveform types). (3)
(b) **Filter settings and modulation** (filter type, cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope or LFO modulation). (3)
(c) **Effects chain** with at least **4 effects**, including specific parameter settings (e.g., reverb time, delay sync, chorus depth). (4)

*Include specific parameter values throughout your response to demonstrate detailed technical knowledge.*
