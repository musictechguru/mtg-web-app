```

**C. Frequency Allocation Chart**

Visual guide showing:
```
20-60 Hz:     Sub-bass (mono)
60-80 Hz:     Kick fundamental
80-200 Hz:    Bass body, kick body
200-500 Hz:   Lower mids (often scooped in EDM)
500Hz-2kHz:   Mids (vocals, some synths)
2-5 kHz:      Upper mids (presence, clarity)
5-10 kHz:     Highs (brightness, definition)
10-20 kHz:    Air, sparkle, hi-hats
```

**D. Sidechain Compression Setup Guide**

Step-by-step:
```
1. Setup:
   • Insert compressor on bass/pad channel
   • Enable sidechain/external key input
   • Route kick drum to sidechain input

2. Settings:
   • Threshold: -20 to -30dB (adjust to taste)
   • Ratio: 4:1 to 10:1 (higher = more pumping)
   • Attack: 10-30ms (allows some transient through)
   • Release: 100-300ms (timed to groove, typically 1/8 or 1/16 note)
   • Knee: Soft or hard depending on desired character
   • Makeup gain: Adjust as needed

3. Common Applications:
   • Bass vs. Kick (essential)
   • Pads vs. Kick (create space)
   • Leads vs. Kick (subtle pumping)
   • Full mix vs. Kick (extreme pumping effect)
```

**E. Build and Drop Arrangement Guide**

```
BUILD-UP (8-16 bars):
• Start: Previous section ending
• Add: Riser (white noise sweep, HPF automation)
• Add: Snare rolls (increasing frequency)
• Add: Kick drum pattern (last 4-8 bars)
• Process: Filter sweep on melodic elements (close LPF, automate to open)
• Process: Reverb increase (automation)
• Effects: Impact/downlifter on last beat before drop
• Remove: Bass in last 1-2 bars (creates space for drop impact)

DROP (16-32 bars):
• Beat 1: Full impact, kick + bass + all elements
• Arrangement: Full production, maximum energy
• Sidechain: Heavy pumping effect
• Mix: Loud, wide, powerful
• Structure: 16-bar main hook, possible 8-bar variation
```

**F. Essential EDM Tools & Plugins**

```
SYNTHESIZERS:
• Serum (wavetable)
• Sylenth1 (supersaw classic)
• Vital (free wavetable)
• Massive X
• Diva (analog emulation)

EFFECTS:
• FabFilter Pro-Q 3 (EQ)
• FabFilter Pro-C 2 (compression)
• Valhalla VintageVerb (reverb)
• EchoBoy / H-Delay (delay)
• Soundtoys Decapitator (saturation)
• Kickstart / Nicky Romero Kickstart (sidechain)

MASTERING:
• Ozone (mastering suite)
• FabFilter Pro-L 2 (limiting)
• iZotope Insight (metering)
```

**G. Common EDM Production Mistakes**

```
❌ Sub-bass in stereo → ✓ Mono below 120Hz
❌ Kick and bass fighting → ✓ EQ separation + sidechain
❌ Muddy low-mids → ✓ Cut 200-500Hz on non-bass elements
❌ Weak drops → ✓ Remove bass before drop for impact
❌ Quiet compared to reference → ✓ Proper limiting and saturation
❌ Narrow mix → ✓ Stereo widening on leads/pads
❌ No pumping effect → ✓ Sidechain compression properly set
❌ Undefined supersaw → ✓ Proper detune amount (15-25 cents)
```

2. Describe the process of setting up sidechain compression on a bass synth
   triggered by the kick drum, including appropriate attack and release settings. (4)

MARK SCHEME:
Award 1 mark for each valid step/parameter, maximum 4:

Setup:
✓ Insert compressor on bass track/channel
✓ Enable sidechain input / external key
✓ Route kick drum to sidechain input / send kick to compressor sidechain

Settings:
✓ Attack: 10-30ms / fast attack allowing some transient

✓ Ratio: 4:1 to 10:1 / high ratio for obvious pumping
✓ Threshold: -20 to -30dB / adjust until ducking occurs

Don't credit: General compression terminology without sidechain context

3. State three frequency ranges you would boost or cut when mixing an EDM kick drum
   to achieve punch, clarity and sub-bass power. Include whether to boost or cut. (3)

MARK SCHEME:
Award 1 mark for each frequency range + action, maximum 3:
