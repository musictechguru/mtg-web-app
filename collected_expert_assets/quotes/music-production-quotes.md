> "I'm just trying to make my favorite music. That's how I work; I just do things based on the way they feel to me. I want to be touched by the music I'm making."

> "I never decide if an idea is good or bad until I try it."

> "So much of what gets in the way of things being good is thinking that we know. The more that we can remove any baggage we're carrying with us and just be in the moment, use our ears, pay attention to what's happening and just listen to the inner voice that directs us, the better."

> "In terms of priority, inspiration comes first. You come next. The audience comes last."

> "Usually when I start a new project there's a fear of the unknown; maybe it's a band I've never been in the studio with before. People are so different. It's almost like you need to go through the process, discover and unlock what it is that makes that band that band."

> "My job has very little to do with music. It has more to do with taste and culture and balance."

> "If you know what you want to do and you do it, that's the work of a craftsman. If you begin with a question and use it to guide an adventure of discovery, that's the work of the artist."

> "Most studio units — traditionally regarded as simple devices for altering or modifying a set sound — can be employed as instruments in their own right."

> "A studio is an absolute labyrinth of possibilities — this is why records take so long to make because there are millions of permutations of things you can do. The most useful thing you can do is to get rid of some of those options before you start."

> "I'm a painter in sound."

> "For me it's always contingent on getting a sound — the sound always suggests what kind of melody it should be. So it's always sound first and then the line afterwards."

> "Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided."

> "Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them as triggers for experiences."

> "Set up a situation that presents you with something slightly beyond your reach."

> "The difficulty of always feeling that you ought to be doing something is that you tend to undervalue the times when you're apparently doing nothing, and those are very important times."

> "Ideas reflect the moment, and so you have to use them. If you store ideas, they wither."

> "As a maker you tend to put in twice as much as you need as a listener."

> "Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular."

> "Every collaboration helps you grow."

> "One of the things you do when you make a piece of art is you try to make the world you'd rather be in."

> "Every day, my daddy told me the same thing. 'Once a task is just begun, never leave it till it's done. Be the labour great or small, do it well or not at all.'"

> "I never cared about money or fame, and I don't care now. I follow the groove, and money always follows."

> "Music is the soul of the universe. It connects us all on a level that words alone cannot reach."

> "Without the Fender bass, there'd be no rock n' roll or no Motown. The electric guitar had been waiting 'round since 1939 for a nice partner to come along."

> "Music in movies is all about dissonance and consonance, tension and release."

> "If architecture is frozen music then music must be liquid architecture."

> "Passion is the fuel that drives greatness. Without it, we are just going through the motions."

---

## Eddie Kramer

> "Mixing is way more art and soul than science. We don't really know what we're doing. We've all been faking it for 40 years. We do it because we love music. It's what gets me going every day. It's the love of music first."

---

## Niko Bolas

---

## Robert Scovill (FOH Engineer)

> "There's just as much skill in revealing something as there is in bringing something up. It's not always about louder, it might be a matter of pulling something back so something else shines through."

---

## Kim Watson

> "Everybody around me said I couldn't do this. It was like, 'You can't' or 'You'll never be in the music industry.' But whenever anybody says I can't do something, that's the driver for me to run with it."

---

# SECOND TIER ENGINEERS & PRODUCERS

## Andrew Scheps

> "Music is a language, and the mixing engineer's job is to help the artist communicate their message as clearly and powerfully as possible."

> "Great music is not about perfection; it's about capturing the emotion and the human element in a performance."

> "Mixing is not just about balancing levels and EQs; it's about creating a sonic world that transports the listener and takes them on a journey."

> "The best mixes are the ones where you can't hear the individual elements, but rather the sum of all the parts working together in harmony."

> "The most important piece of gear in any studio is the set of ears attached to the engineer's head."

> "I listen really loud or really quietly. The really loud is because I can feel things and I know that it's good. Also, I can't kid myself about something because whatever is bad is really loud bad. Then really quiet is because when it's really quiet all you can hear is the mix, as a whole, just balanced."

---

## Chris Lord-Alge

> "You have to have 100 percent focus or it doesn't work. The best mixes can be the ones that just happen when you're under pressure and have no choice. There is no relaxing… It's more like a car race with excitement."

> "I have camped in front of an E-series SSL since it came out in 1985, and I don't think SSL have since improved on the concept of that console."

> "I throw the faders up and see what the song is, then try and EQ everything at once, adding effects to everything then work my way back. I try to blow it up first then control the beast."

---

## Bernie Grundman

> "Sound quality will always go downhill as you do more processing or manipulation. There's a price to pay, no matter how good the equipment or even our system."

> "A lot of newer engineers have their heads so buried in their computers that they are intoxicated by the technology. They're so fascinated by what they can do to manipulate the signal that they're not listening to what they're doing to the music."

> "You have to realize that you want to get more out than you're losing. You have to be careful of that because we have a lot more equipment now, many more things we can manipulate and so much more we can do."

> "Just like with recording, I like keeping the signal path as simple as possible."

> "Mastering is basically post-production for the recording industry — the final creative step before delivery to the manufacturer for mass production."

---

## Bob Ludwig

> "Mastering is the final creative step in the record making chain and the first step in the manufacturing process. The purpose of creative mastering is to enhance as much of the musicality that is inherent in the master mixes we are given."

> "Music has always been my love. I'll miss you and the whole music community with whom I've worked. I wake up every day enjoying what I do, which has been such a blessing."

> "Our company slogan is 'perfect is good enough.'"

---

## Steve Albini

> "If a record takes more than a week to make, somebody's fucking up."

> "All an album should be is a representation of a band doing its thing presented in a permanent format. It shouldn't take a month to do that."

> "If I'm working as an engineer for another band, the responsibility for brilliance pretty much rests on their shoulders. I think I'm pretty good, but I'm not good enough to turn a trout into a sausage, or the other way around."

> "I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band. I would like to be paid like a plumber."

> "Find people who think like you and stick with them. Make only music you are passionate about. Work only with people you like and trust. Don't sign anything."

> "I'm only interested in working on records that legitimately reflect the band's own perception of their music and existence. If you commit yourselves to that as a tenet of the recording methodology, then I will bust my ass for you."

> "Doubt the conventional wisdom unless you can verify it with reason and experiment."

> "Know what you're trying to do before you do it. Turning knobs at random isn't enlightening any more than throwing paint at a wall blindfolded will let you paint a nice picture."

> "I don't think anyone has exhausted the range of sound possible in a conventional rock band, but people do become slaves to their own easiest techniques."

> "There is nothing better than the sound of a drum kit in an empty room."

---

## Tony Visconti

> "The more technology you have the less talent is applied to making records because technology is full of magic tricks. You can do everything after a song is recorded: change the tempo, slow it down, whatever. You can take a mediocre artist and make them sound very good, but it is not satisfying and like fast food."

> "Drug use was rife in the 70s and lots of people getting stoned out of their brains. I did in my own time, but I couldn't afford to in the studio. I had to be the sober one. It was like being a designated driver."

---

## Tchad Blake

> "I couldn't get arrested in the '80s to mix anything."

> "The kinds of sounds we liked — crunchy sounds... somewhere between Tom Waits and the slick side, high contrast — started getting more fashionable."

> "I'm an engineer, basically. There are different kinds of producers and there's room for all of them. Different artists require different things."

> "I'm 99.8% in the box now, as opposed to mixing off tape through a vintage API console at The Sound Factory or the very large SSL at Real World Studios in the past. The 0.2% represents instruments I add or pedal-style effects I use."

> "Many of my clients could no longer afford proper studio rates and I was losing work because of that."

> "Tchad is a creative monster. He is the guy who does things differently, all the time."

---

## Tom Elmhirst

> "Mixing is something that you either have, or you don't. You can learn the techniques, but after that you have to feel it. I don't think it's something that you can study. Music and mixing are so arbitrary in that sense."

> "I enjoy mixing most when I stop thinking about what I'm doing. It's like when you're a kid, and you learn to ride a bike. Once you can do it, you don't think about the method any more. This is exactly how I approach mixing. I just do it, and if it feels good, I go with it."

> "For me it is about marrying the best of the old and the best of the new. I just could not mix in-the-box, I would not enjoy that in the same way. I could not live without faders and outboard gear. But I could also not live without ProTools."

> "With mixing, experience is everything. If you look at the top mixers in the world at the moment, they are not young cats, they are mostly in their 40s and older."

> "I also use parallel compression a lot more than in the past, though I find that compression is over-used these days as a quick fix. I shy away from heavy compression and also limiting."

> "I actually spent some time talking with Tchad Blake about working in-the-box, and realised that if he, the ultimate analogue effects guy, can do it, then I don't have any excuses."

---

## Butch Vig

> "While it can be quite overwhelming when considering all the sonic options available in today's recording environment, it's important to always understand the artist's vision, and to pick and choose between all the tools available to help find that vision."

> "Engineers and producers these days have such a big palette to work from and to choose from – it's mind-blowing. Still, at the end of the day, what everyone's aspiring to do is to record a song that connects with somebody."

> "When I started out, I was obsessed with the engineering and sonic aspect of recording. I've realized as a producer that much of what I do is psychological; trying to understand an artist's vision; what you need to do to motivate them and understand how to make the best song or album that you can."

> "Often it's psychotherapy—being a cheerleader. Sometimes you have to kick the artist in the ass and challenge them. Yet every song and every project is different."

> "You have to trust your instincts. If something is bothering me, I'll say so."

> "When the budget runs out. I'm guilty of this more in Garbage. I'm co-writing songs with my bandmates and I can get obsessed with details and the possibilities of what can be done. It's like a big canvas and you keep throwing paint on it. It's hard to know when it's done."

> "If you're going to co-produce with someone, it's important that you both understand where the project is going. I would never want to work with someone if we didn't share the same sensibility or vision."

> "Kurt Cobain originally refused to double-track his vocals and guitars but I reportedly got him to comply by saying 'John Lennon double-tracked.'"
